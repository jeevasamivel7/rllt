<h4>The Wiles of a Harlot</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-1.htm">1</a>My son, keep my words,
And treasure my commands within you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-2.htm">2</a>Keep my commands and live,
And my law as the apple of your eye.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-3.htm">3</a>Bind them on your fingers;
Write them on the tablet of your heart.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-4.htm">4</a>Say to wisdom, "You are my sister,"
And call understanding your nearest kin,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-5.htm">5</a>That they may keep you from the immoral woman,
From the seductress who flatters with her words.</p>
<h4>The Crafty Harlot</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-6.htm">6</a>For at the window of my house
I looked through my lattice,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-7.htm">7</a>And saw among the simple,
I perceived among the youths,
A young man devoid of understanding,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-8.htm">8</a>Passing along the street near her corner;
And he took the path to her house</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-9.htm">9</a>In the twilight, in the evening,
In the black and dark night.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-10.htm">10</a>And there a woman met him,
With the attire of a harlot, and a crafty heart.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-11.htm">11</a>She was loud and rebellious,
Her feet would not stay at home.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-12.htm">12</a>At times she was outside, at times in the open square,
Lurking at every corner.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-13.htm">13</a>So she caught him and kissed him;
With an impudent face she said to him:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-14.htm">14</a>"I have peace offerings with me;
Today I have paid my vows.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-15.htm">15</a>So I came out to meet you,
Diligently to seek your face,
And I have found you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-16.htm">16</a>I have spread my bed with tapestry,
Colored coverings of Egyptian linen.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-17.htm">17</a>I have perfumed my bed
With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-18.htm">18</a>Come, let us take our fill of love until morning;
Let us delight ourselves with love.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-19.htm">19</a>For my husband is not at home;
He has gone on a long journey;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-20.htm">20</a>He has taken a bag of money with him,
And will come home on the appointed day."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-21.htm">21</a>With her enticing speech she caused him to yield,
With her flattering lips she seduced him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-22.htm">22</a>Immediately he went after her, as an ox goes to the slaughter,
Or as a fool to the correction of the stocks,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-23.htm">23</a>Till an arrow struck his liver.
As a bird hastens to the snare,
He did not know it would cost his life.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-24.htm">24</a>Now therefore, listen to me, my children;
Pay attention to the words of my mouth:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-25.htm">25</a>Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways,
Do not stray into her paths;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-26.htm">26</a>For she has cast down many wounded,
And all who were slain by her were strong men.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-27.htm">27</a>Her house is the way to hell,
Descending to the chambers of death.</p>
