<h2>Proverbs 29  </h2>

<h4>Happy Is He Who Keeps the Law   </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-1.htm." target="_blank">1</a>He who is often rebuked, and hardens his neck,Will suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-2.htm." target="_blank">2</a>When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice;But when a wicked man rules, the people groan.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-3.htm." target="_blank">3</a>Whoever loves wisdom makes his father rejoice,But a companion of harlots wastes his wealth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-4.htm." target="_blank">4</a>The king establishes the land by justice,But he who receives bribes overthrows it.<p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-5.htm." target="_blank">5</a>A man who flatters his neighbor Spreads a net for his feet.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-6.htm." target="_blank">6</a>By transgression an evil man is snared,But the righteous sings and rejoices.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-7.htm." target="_blank">7</a>The righteous considers the cause of the poor,But the wicked does not understand such knowledge.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-8.htm." target="_blank">8</a>Scoffers set a city aflame,But wise men turn away wrath.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-9.htm." target="_blank">9</a>If a wise man contends with a foolish man,Whether the fool rages or laughs, there is no peace.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-10.htm." target="_blank">10</a>The bloodthirsty hate the blameless,But the upright seek his well-being.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-11.htm." target="_blank">11</a>A fool vents all his feelings,But a wise man holds them back.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-12.htm." target="_blank">12</a>If a ruler pays attention to lies,All his servants become wicked.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-13.htm." target="_blank">13</a>The poor man and the oppressor have this in common:The Lord gives light to the eyes of both.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-14.htm." target="_blank">14</a>The king who judges the poor with truth,His throne will be established forever.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-15.htm." target="_blank">15</a>The rod and rebuke give wisdom,But a child left to himself brings shame to his mother.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-16.htm." target="_blank">16</a>When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increases;But the righteous will see their fall.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-17.htm." target="_blank">17</a>Correct your son, and he will give you rest;Yes, he will give delight to your soul.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-18.htm." target="_blank">18</a>Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint;But happy is he who keeps the law.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-19.htm." target="_blank">19</a>A servant will not be corrected by mere words;For though he understands, he will not respond.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-20.htm." target="_blank">20</a>Do you see a man hasty in his words?There is more hope for a fool than for him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-21.htm." target="_blank">21</a>He who pampers his servant from childhood Will have him as a son in the end.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-22.htm." target="_blank">22</a>An angry man stirs up strife,And a furious man abounds in transgression.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-23.htm." target="_blank">23</a>A man's pride will bring him low,But the humble in spirit will retain honor.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-24.htm." target="_blank">24</a>Whoever is a partner with a thief hates his own life;He swears to tell the truth, but reveals nothing.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-25.htm." target="_blank">25</a>The fear of man brings a snare,But whoever trusts in the Lord shall be safe.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-26.htm." target="_blank">26</a>Many seek the ruler's favor,But justice for man comes from the Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-27.htm." target="_blank">27</a>An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous,And he who is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked.</p>
