<h2> Proverbs 27  </h2>

<h4>  My Son, Be Wise </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-1.htm." target="_blank">1</a>Do not boast about tomorrow,For you do not know what a day may bring forth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-2.htm." target="_blank">2</a>Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth;A stranger, and not your own lips.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-3.htm." target="_blank">3</a>A stone is heavy and sand is weighty,But a fool's wrath is heavier than both of them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-4.htm." target="_blank">4</a>Wrath is cruel and anger a torrent,But who is able to stand before jealousy?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-5.htm." target="_blank">5</a>Open rebuke is better Than love carefully concealed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-6.htm." target="_blank">6</a>Faithful are the wounds of a friend,But the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-7.htm." target="_blank">7</a>A satisfied soul loathes the honeycomb,But to a hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-8.htm." target="_blank">8</a>Like a bird that wanders from its nest Is a man who wanders from his place.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-9.htm." target="_blank">9</a>Ointment and perfume delight the heart,And the sweetness of a man's friend gives delight by hearty counsel.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-10.htm." target="_blank">10</a>Do not forsake your own friend or your father's friend,Nor go to your brother's house in the day of your calamity;Better is a neighbor nearby than a brother far away.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-11.htm." target="_blank">11</a>My son, be wise, and make my heart glad,That I may answer him who reproaches me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-12.htm." target="_blank">12</a>A prudent man foresees evil and hides himself;The simple pass on and are punished.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-13.htm." target="_blank">13</a>Take the garment of him who is surety for a stranger,And hold it in pledge when he is surety for a seductress.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-14.htm." target="_blank">14</a>He who blesses his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, It will be counted a curse to him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-15.htm." target="_blank">15</a>A continual dripping on a very rainy day And a contentious woman are alike;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-16.htm." target="_blank">16</a>Whoever restrains her restrains the wind,And grasps oil with his right hand.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-17.htm." target="_blank">17</a>As iron sharpens iron,So a man sharpens the countenance of his friend.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-18.htm." target="_blank">18</a>Whoever keeps the fig tree will eat its fruit;So he who waits on his master will be honored.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-19.htm." target="_blank">19</a>As in water face reflects face,So a man's heart reveals the man.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-20.htm." target="_blank">20</a>Hell and Destruction are never full;So the eyes of man are never satisfied.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-21.htm." target="_blank">21</a>The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold,And a man is valued by what others say of him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-22.htm." target="_blank">22</a>Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with crushed grain,Yet his foolishness will not depart from him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-23.htm." target="_blank">23</a>Be diligent to know the state of your flocks,And attend to your herds;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-24.htm." target="_blank">24</a>For riches are not forever,Nor does a crown endure to all generations.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-25.htm." target="_blank">25</a>When the hay is removed, and the tender grass shows itself,And the herbs of the mountains are gathered in,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-26.htm." target="_blank">26</a>The lambs will provide your clothing,And the goats the price of a field;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-27.htm." target="_blank">27</a>You shall have enough goats' milk for your food,For the food of your household,And the nourishment of your maidservants.</p>
