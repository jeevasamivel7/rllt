    <h2> Proverbs 13 </h2>
    
    <h4>Wisdom Loves Righteousness</h4>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-1.htm" target="-blank">1</a>A wise son heeds his father’s instruction,
        But a scoffer does not listen to rebuke.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-2.htm" target="-blank">2</a>A man shall eat well by the fruit of his mouth,
        But the soul of the unfaithful feeds on violence.<br>
         <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-3.htm" target="-blank">3</a>He who guards his mouth preserves his life,
        But he who opens wide his lips shall have destruction.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-4.htm" target="-blank">4</a>The soul of a lazy man desires, and has nothing;
        But the soul of the diligent shall be made rich.<br>
         <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-5.htm" target="-blank">5</a>A righteous man hates lying,
        But a wicked man is loathsome and comes to shame.<br>
         <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-6.htm" target="-blank">6</a>Righteousness guards him whose way is blameless,
        But wickedness overthrows the sinner.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-7.htm" target="-blank">7</a>There is one who makes himself rich, yet has nothing;
        And one who makes himself poor, yet has great riches.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-8.htm" target="-blank">8</a>The ransom of a man’s life is his riches,
        But the poor does not hear rebuke.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-9.htm" target="-blank">9</a>The light of the righteous rejoices,
        But the lamp of the wicked will be put out.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-10.htm" target="-blank">10</a>By pride comes nothing but strife,
        But with the well-advised is wisdom.
        </p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-11.htm" target="-blank">11</a>Wealth gained by dishonesty will be diminished,
        But he who gathers by labor will increase.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-12.htm" target="-blank">12</a>Hope deferred makes the heart sick,
        But when the desire comes, it is a tree of life.</p>

    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-13.htm" target="-blank">13</a>He who despises the word will be destroyed,
        But he who fears the commandment will be rewarded.
        <br> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-14.htm" target="-blank">14</a>The law of the wise is a fountain of life,
        To turn one away from the snares of death.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-15.htm" target="-blank">15</a>Good understanding gains favor,
        But the way of the unfaithful is hard.
        <br> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-16.htm" target="-blank">16</a>Every prudent man acts with knowledge,
        But a fool lays open his folly.<br>
         <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-17.htm" target="-blank">17</a>A wicked messenger falls into trouble,
        But a faithful ambassador brings health.
        <br> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-18.htm" target="-blank">18</a>Poverty and shame will come to him who disdains correction,
        But he who regards a rebuke will be honored.
        <br>> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-19.htm" target="-blank">19</a>A desire accomplished is sweet to the soul,
        But it is an abomination to fools to depart from evil.</p>
     <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-20.htm" target="-blank">20</a>He who walks with wise men will be wise,
        But the companion of fools will be destroyed.
        <br> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-21.htm" target="-blank">21</a>Evil pursues sinners,
        But to the righteous, good shall be repaid.</p>
   <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-22.htm" target="-blank">22</a>A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children,
    But the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous.<br>
     <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-23.htm" target="-blank">23</a>Much food is in the fallow ground of the poor,
        And for lack of justice there is waste.</p>
     <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-24.htm" target="-blank">24</a>He who spares his rod hates his son,
        But he who loves him disciplines him promptly.</p>
     <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-25.htm" target="-blank">25</a>The righteous eats to the satisfying of his soul,
        But the stomach of the wicked shall be in want.</p>
