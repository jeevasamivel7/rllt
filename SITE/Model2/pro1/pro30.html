<h2>Proverbs 30  </h2>

<h4> The Wisdom of Agur  </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-1.htm." target="_blank">1</a>The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, his utterance. This man declared to Ithiel-to Ithiel and Ucal:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-2.htm." target="_blank">2</a>Surely I am more stupid than any man,And do not have the understanding of a man.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-3.htm." target="_blank">3</a>I neither learned wisdom Nor have knowledge of the Holy One.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-4.htm." target="_blank">4</a>Who has ascended into heaven, or descended?Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has bound the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth?What is His name, and what is His Son's name,If you know?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-5.htm." target="_blank">5</a>Every word of God is pure;He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-6.htm." target="_blank">6</a>Do not add to His words,Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-7.htm." target="_blank">7</a>Two things I request of You(Deprive me not before I die):</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-8.htm." target="_blank">8</a>Remove falsehood and lies far from me;Give me neither poverty nor riches- Feed me with the food allotted to me;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-9.htm." target="_blank">9</a>Lest I be full and deny You,And say, "Who is the Lord?"Or lest I be poor and steal,And profane the name of my God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-10.htm." target="_blank">10</a>Do not malign a servant to his master,Lest he curse you, and you be found guilty.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-11.htm." target="_blank">11</a>There is a generation that curses its father,And does not bless its mother.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-12.htm." target="_blank">12</a>There is a generation that is pure in its own eyes,Yet is not washed from its filthiness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-13.htm." target="_blank">13</a>There is a generation-oh, how lofty are their eyes!And their eyelids are lifted up.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-14.htm." target="_blank">14</a>There is a generation whose teeth are like swords,And whose fangs are like knives,To devour the poor from off the earth,And the needy from among men.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-15.htm." target="_blank">15</a>The leech has two daughters- Give and Give! There are three things that are never satisfied,Four never say, "Enough!":</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-16.htm." target="_blank">16</a>The grave,The barren womb,The earth that is not satisfied with water-And the fire never says, "Enough!"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-17.htm." target="_blank">17</a>The eye that mocks his father,And scorns obedience to his mother,The ravens of the valley will pick it out,And the young eagles will eat it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-18.htm." target="_blank">18</a>There are three things which are too wonderful for me,Yes, four which I do not understand:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-19.htm." target="_blank">19</a>The way of an eagle in the air,The way of a serpent on a rock,The way of a ship in the midst of the sea,And the way of a man with a virgin.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-20.htm." target="_blank">20</a>This is the way of an adulterous woman:She eats and wipes her mouth,And says, "I have done no wickedness."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-21.htm." target="_blank">21</a>For three things the earth is perturbed,Yes, for four it cannot bear up:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-22.htm." target="_blank">22</a>For a servant when he reigns,A fool when he is filled with food,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-23.htm." target="_blank">23</a>A hateful woman when she is married,And a maidservant who succeeds her mistress.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-24.htm." target="_blank">24</a>There are four things which are little on the earth,But they are exceedingly wise:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-25.htm." target="_blank">25</a>The ants are a people not strong,Yet they prepare their food in the summer;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-26.htm." target="_blank">26</a>The rock badgers are a feeble folk,Yet they make their homes in the crags;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-27.htm." target="_blank">27</a>The locusts have no king,Yet they all advance in ranks;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-28.htm." target="_blank">28</a>The spider skillfully grasps with its hands,And it is in kings- palaces.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-29.htm." target="_blank">29</a>There are three things which are majestic in pace,Yes, four which are stately in walk:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-30.htm." target="_blank">30</a>A lion, which is mighty among beasts And does not turn away from any;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-31.htm." target="_blank">31</a>A greyhound,A male goat also,And a king whose troops are with him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-32.htm." target="_blank">32</a>If you have been foolish in exalting yourself,Or if you have devised evil, put your hand on your mouth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-33.htm." target="_blank">33</a>For as the churning of milk produces butter,And wringing the nose produces blood,So the forcing of wrath produces strife.</p>
