<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>The silver-haired head is a crown of glory,If it is found in the way of righteousness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty,And he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>The lot is cast into the lap,But its every decision is from the Lord.</p>
