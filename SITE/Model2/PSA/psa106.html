<h2>  Psalms 106</h2>

<h4>  Joy in Forgiveness of Israel's Sins </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Praise the Lord!Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good!For His mercy endures forever.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord?Who can declare all His praise?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Blessed are those who keep justice,And he who does righteousness at all times!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Remember me, O Lord, with the favor You have toward Your people.Oh, visit me with Your salvation,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>That I may see the benefit of Your chosen ones,That I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation,That I may glory with Your inheritance.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>We have sinned with our fathers,We have committed iniquity,We have done wickedly.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Our fathers in Egypt did not understand Your wonders;They did not remember the multitude of Your mercies,But rebelled by the sea-the Red Sea.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Nevertheless He saved them for His name's sake,That He might make His mighty power known.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it dried up;So He led them through the depths,As through the wilderness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>He saved them from the hand of him who hated them,And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>The waters covered their enemies;There was not one of them left.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Then they believed His words;They sang His praise.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>They soon forgot His works;They did not wait for His counsel,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness,And tested God in the desert.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>And He gave them their request,But sent leanness into their soul.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>When they envied Moses in the camp,And Aaron the saint of the Lord,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan,And covered the faction of Abiram.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>A fire was kindled in their company;The flame burned up the wicked.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>They made a calf in Horeb,And worshiped the molded image.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Thus they changed their glory Into the image of an ox that eats grass.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>They forgot God their Savior,Who had done great things in Egypt,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Wondrous works in the land of Ham,Awesome things by the Red Sea.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Therefore He said that He would destroy them,Had not Moses His chosen one stood before Him in the breach,To turn away His wrath, lest He destroy them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>Then they despised the pleasant land;They did not believe His word,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>But complained in their tents,And did not heed the voice of the Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>Therefore He raised His hand in an oath against them,To overthrow them in the wilderness,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>To overthrow their descendants among the nations,And to scatter them in the lands.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>They joined themselves also to Baal of Peor,And ate sacrifices made to the dead.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-28.htm" target="_blank">29</a>Thus they provoked Him to anger with their deeds,And the plague broke out among them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>Then Phinehas stood up and intervened,And the plague was stopped.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>And that was accounted to him for righteousness To all generations forevermore.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>They angered Him also at the waters of strife,So that it went ill with Moses on account of them;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>Because they rebelled against His Spirit,So that he spoke rashly with his lips.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>They did not destroy the peoples,Concerning whom the Lord had commanded them,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a>But they mingled with the Gentiles And learned their works;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-36.htm" target="_blank">36</a>They served their idols,Which became a snare to them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-37.htm" target="_blank">37</a>They even sacrificed their sons And their daughters to demons,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-38.htm" target="_blank">38</a>And shed innocent blood,The blood of their sons and daughters,Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan;And the land was polluted with blood.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-39.htm" target="_blank">39</a>Thus they were defiled by their own works,And played the harlot by their own deeds.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-40.htm" target="_blank">40</a>Therefore the wrath of the Lord was kindled against His people,So that He abhorred His own inheritance.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-41.htm" target="_blank">41</a>And He gave them into the hand of the Gentiles,And those who hated them ruled over them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-42.htm" target="_blank">42</a>Their enemies also oppressed them,And they were brought into subjection under their hand.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-43.htm" target="_blank">43</a>Many times He delivered them;But they rebelled in their counsel,And were brought low for their iniquity.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-44.htm" target="_blank">44</a>Nevertheless He regarded their affliction,When He heard their cry;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-45.htm" target="_blank">45</a>And for their sake He remembered His covenant,And relented according to the multitude of His mercies.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-46.htm" target="_blank">46</a>He also made them to be pitied By all those who carried them away captive.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-47.htm" target="_blank">47</a>Save us, O Lord our God,And gather us from among the Gentiles To give thanks to Your holy name,To triumph in Your praise.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-48.htm" target="_blank">48</a>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel From everlasting to everlasting!And let all the people say, "Amen!" Praise the Lord!</p>
