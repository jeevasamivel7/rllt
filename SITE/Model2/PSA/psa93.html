<h2>Psalms 93 </h2>

<h4> The Eternal Reign of the Lord  </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/93-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>The Lord reigns, He is clothed with majesty;The Lord is clothed,He has girded Himself with strength.Surely the world is established, so that it cannot be moved.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/93-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Your throne is established from of old;You are from everlasting.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/93-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>The floods have lifted up, O Lord,The floods have lifted up their voice;The floods lift up their waves.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/93-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>The Lord on high is mightier Than the noise of many waters,Than the mighty waves of the sea.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/93-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Your testimonies are very sure;Holiness adorns Your house,O Lord, forever.</p>
