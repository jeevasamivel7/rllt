<h2> Psalms 140 </h2>

<h4> Prayer for Deliverance from Evil Men  </h4>
<h5> To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Deliver me, O Lord, from evil men;Preserve me from violent men,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Who plan evil things in their hearts;They continually gather together for war.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>They sharpen their tongues like a serpent;The poison of asps is under their lips. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked;Preserve me from violent men,Who have purposed to make my steps stumble.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>The proud have hidden a snare for me, and cords;They have spread a net by the wayside;They have set traps for me. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>I said to the Lord: "You are my God;Hear the voice of my supplications, O Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>O God the Lord, the strength of my salvation,You have covered my head in the day of battle.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Do not grant, O Lord, the desires of the wicked;Do not further his wicked scheme,Lest they be exalted. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>"As for the head of those who surround me,Let the evil of their lips cover them;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Let burning coals fall upon them;Let them be cast into the fire,Into deep pits, that they rise not up again.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Let not a slanderer be established in the earth;Let evil hunt the violent man to overthrow him."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>I know that the Lord will maintain The cause of the afflicted,And justice for the poor.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Surely the righteous shall give thanks to Your name;The upright shall dwell in Your presence.</p>
