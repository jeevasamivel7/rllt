<h2> Psalms 85 </h2>

<h4> Prayer that the Lord Will Restore Favor to the Land  </h4>
<h5>  To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. </h5>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Lord, You have been favorable to Your land;You have brought back the captivity of Jacob.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>You have forgiven the iniquity of Your people;You have covered all their sin. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>You have taken away all Your wrath;You have turned from the fierceness of Your anger.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Restore us, O God of our salvation,And cause Your anger toward us to cease.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Will You be angry with us forever?Will You prolong Your anger to all generations?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Will You not revive us again,That Your people may rejoice in You?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Show us Your mercy, Lord,And grant us Your salvation.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>I will hear what God the Lord will speak,For He will speak peace To His people and to His saints;But let them not turn back to folly.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Surely His salvation is near to those who fear Him,That glory may dwell in our land.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Mercy and truth have met together;Righteousness and peace have kissed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Truth shall spring out of the earth,And righteousness shall look down from heaven.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Yes, the Lord will give what is good;And our land will yield its increase.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Righteousness will go before Him,And shall make His footsteps our pathway.</p>
