<h4>Praise to God in Creation and Redemption   </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Praise the Lord!Praise the name of the Lord;Praise Him, O you servants of the Lord!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>You who stand in the house of the Lord,In the courts of the house of our God,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good;Sing praises to His name, for it is pleasant.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>For the Lord has chosen Jacob for Himself,Israel for His special treasure.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>For I know that the Lord is great,And our Lord is above all gods.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Whatever the Lord pleases He does,In heaven and in earth,In the seas and in all deep places.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth;He makes lightning for the rain;He brings the wind out of His treasuries.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>He destroyed the firstborn of Egypt,Both of man and beast.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>He sent signs and wonders into the midst of you, O Egypt,Upon Pharaoh and all his servants.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>He defeated many nations And slew mighty kings-</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Sihon king of the Amorites,Og king of Bashan,And all the kingdoms of Canaan-</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>And gave their land as a heritage,A heritage to Israel His people.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Your name, O Lord, endures forever,Your fame, O Lord, throughout all generations.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>For the Lord will judge His people,And He will have compassion on His servants.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>The idols of the nations are silver and gold,The work of men's hands.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>They have mouths, but they do not speak;Eyes they have, but they do not see;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>They have ears, but they do not hear;Nor is there any breath in their mouths.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Those who make them are like them;So is everyone who trusts in them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Bless the Lord, O house of Israel!Bless the Lord, O house of Aaron!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Bless the Lord, O house of Levi!You who fear the Lord, bless the Lord!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Blessed be the Lord out of Zion,Who dwells in Jerusalem!Praise the Lord!</p>
