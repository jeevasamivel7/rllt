<h2>Psalms 72  </h2>

<h4> Glory and Universality of the Messiah’s Reign  </h4>
<h5> A Psalm of Solomon.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Give the king Your judgments, O God,And Your righteousness to the king’s Son.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>He will judge Your people with righteousness,And Your poor with justice.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>The mountains will bring peace to the people,And the little hills, by righteousness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>He will bring justice to the poor of the people;He will save the children of the needy,And will break in pieces the oppressor.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>They shall fear You As long as the sun and moon endure,Throughout all generations.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>He shall come down like rain upon the grass before mowing,Like showers that water the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>In His days the righteous shall flourish,And abundance of peace,Until the moon is no more.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>He shall have dominion also from sea to sea,And from the River to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Those who dwell in the wilderness will bow before Him,And His enemies will lick the dust.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>The kings of Tarshish and of the isles Will bring presents;The kings of Sheba and SebaWill offer gifts.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Yes, all kings shall fall down before Him;All nations shall serve Him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>For He will deliver the needy when he cries,The poor also, and him who has no helper.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>He will spare the poor and needy,And will save the souls of the needy.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>He will redeem their life from oppression and violence;And precious shall be their blood in His sight.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>And He shall live;And the gold of Sheba will be given to Him;Prayer also will be made for Him continually,And daily He shall be praised.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>There will be an abundance of grain in the earth,On the top of the mountains;Its fruit shall wave like Lebanon;And those of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>His name shall endure forever;His name shall continue as long as the sun.And men shall be blessed in Him;All nations shall call Him blessed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel,Who only does wondrous things!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>And blessed be His glorious name forever!And let the whole earth be filled with His glory.Amen and Amen.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.</p>
