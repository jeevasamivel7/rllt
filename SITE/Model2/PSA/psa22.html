<h2> Psalms 22 </h2>

<h4> The Suffering, Praise, and Posterity of the Messiah  </h4>
<h5> To the Chief Musician. Set to "The Deer of the Dawn." A Psalm of David.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-1.htm">1</a>My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?Why are You so far from helping Me,And from the words of My groaning?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-2.htm">2</a>O My God, I cry in the daytime, but You do not hear;And in the night season, and am not silent.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-3.htm">3</a>But You are holy,Enthroned in the praises of Israel.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-4.htm">4</a>Our fathers trusted in You;They trusted, and You delivered them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-5.htm">5</a>They cried to You, and were delivered;They trusted in You, and were not ashamed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-6.htm">6</a>But I am a worm, and no man;A reproach of men, and despised by the people.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-7.htm">7</a>All those who see Me ridicule Me;They shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-8.htm">8</a>"He trusted in the Lord, let Him rescue Him;Let Him deliver Him, since He delights in Him!"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-9.htm">9</a>But You are He who took Me out of the womb;You made Me trust while on My mother's breasts.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-10.htm">10</a>I was cast upon You from birth.From My mother's wombYou have been My God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-11.htm">11</a>Be not far from Me,For trouble is near;For there is none to help.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-12.htm">12</a>Many bulls have surrounded Me;Strong bulls of Bashan have encircled Me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-13.htm">13</a>They ape at Me with their mouths,Like a raging and roaring lion.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-14.htm">14</a>I am poured out like water,And all My bones are out of joint;My heart is like wax;It has melted within Me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-15.htm">15</a>My strength is dried up like a potsherd,And My tongue clings to My jaws;You have brought Me to the dust of death.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-16.htm">16</a>For dogs have surrounded Me;The congregation of the wicked has enclosed Me.They pierced My hands and My feet;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-17.htm">17</a>I can count all My bones.They look and stare at Me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-18.htm">18</a>They divide My garments among them,And for My clothing they cast lots.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-19.htm">19</a>But You, O Lord, do not be far from Me;O My Strength, hasten to help Me!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-20.htm">20</a>Deliver Me from the sword,My precious life from the power of the dog.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-21.htm">21</a>Save Me from the lion's mouthAnd from the horns of the wild oxen!You have answered Me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-22.htm">22</a>I will declare Your name to My brethren;In the midst of the assembly I will praise You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-23.htm">23</a>You who fear the Lord, praise Him!All you descendants of Jacob, glorify Him,And fear Him, all you offspring of Israel!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-24.htm">24</a>For He has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted;Nor has He hidden His face from Him;But when He cried to Him, He heard.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-25.htm">25</a>My praise shall be of You in the great assembly;I will pay My vows before those who fear Him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-26.htm">26</a>The poor shall eat and be satisfied;Those who seek Him will praise the Lord.Let your heart live forever!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-27.htm">27</a>All the ends of the worldShall remember and turn to the Lord,And all the families of the nationsShall worship before You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-28.htm">28</a>For the kingdom is the Lord's,And He rules over the nations.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-29.htm">29</a>All the prosperous of the earthShall eat and worship;All those who go down to the dustShall bow before Him,Even he who cannot keep himself alive.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-30.htm">30</a>A posterity shall serve Him.It will be recounted of the Lord to the next generation,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-31.htm">31</a>They will come and declare His righteousness to a people who will be born,That He has done this.</p>
