<h2> Psalms 132 </h2>

<h4>  The Eternal Dwelling of God in Zion </h4>
<h5>  A Song of Ascents. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Lord, remember David And all his afflictions;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>How he swore to the Lord,And vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>"Surely I will not go into the chamber of my house,Or go up to the comfort of my bed;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>I will not give sleep to my eyes Or slumber to my eyelids,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Until I find a place for the Lord,A dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah;We found it in the fields of the woods.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Let us go into His tabernacle;Let us worship at His footstool.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Arise, O Lord, to Your resting place,You and the ark of Your strength.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Let Your priests be clothed with righteousness,And let Your saints shout for joy.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>For Your servant David's sake,Do not turn away the face of Your Anointed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>The Lord has sworn in truth to David;He will not turn from it:"I will set upon your throne the fruit of your body.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>If your sons will keep My covenant And My testimony which I shall teach them,Their sons also shall sit upon your throne forevermore."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>For the Lord has chosen Zion;He has desired it for His dwelling place:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>"This is My resting place forever;Here I will dwell, for I have desired it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>I will abundantly bless her provision;I will satisfy her poor with bread.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>I will also clothe her priests with salvation,And her saints shall shout aloud for joy.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>There I will make the horn of David grow;I will prepare a lamp for My Anointed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>His enemies I will clothe with shame,But upon Himself His crown shall flourish."</p>
