<h2> Psalms 9 </h2>

<h4> Prayer and Thanksgiving for the Lord's Righteous Judgments
To the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Death of the Son." A Psalm of David.</h4>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-1.htm">1</a>I will praise You, O Lord, with my whole heart;I will tell of all Your marvelous works.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-2.htm">2</a>I will be glad and rejoice in You;I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-3.htm">3</a>When my enemies turn back,They shall fall and perish at Your presence.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-4.htm">4</a>For You have maintained my right and my cause;You sat on the throne judging in righteousness.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-5.htm">5</a>You have rebuked the nations,You have destroyed the wicked;You have blotted out their name forever and ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-6.htm">6</a>O enemy, destructions are finished forever!And you have destroyed cities;Even their memory has perished.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-7.htm">7</a>But the Lord shall endure forever;He has prepared His throne for judgment.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-8.htm">8</a>He shall judge the world in righteousness,And He shall administer judgment for the peoples in uprightness.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-9.htm">9</a>The Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed,A refuge in times of trouble.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-10.htm">10</a>And those who know Your name will put their trust in You;For You, Lord, have not forsaken those who seek You.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-11.htm">11</a>Sing praises to the Lord, who dwells in Zion!Declare His deeds among the people.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-12.htm">12</a>When He avenges blood, He remembers them;He does not forget the cry of the humble.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-13.htm">13</a>Have mercy on me, O Lord!Consider my trouble from those who hate me,You who lift me up from the gates of death,</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-14.htm">14</a>That I may tell of all Your praiseIn the gates of the daughter of Zion.I will rejoice in Your salvation.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-15.htm">15</a>The nations have sunk down in the pit which they made;In the net which they hid, their own foot is caught.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-16.htm">16</a>The Lord is known by the judgment He executes;The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands.Meditation. Selah</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-17.htm">17</a>The wicked shall be turned into hell,And all the nations that forget God.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-18.htm">18</a>For the needy shall not always be forgotten;The expectation of the poor shall not perish forever.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-19.htm">19</a>Arise, O Lord,Do not let man prevail;Let the nations be judged in Your sight.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-20.htm">20</a>Put them in fear, O Lord,That the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah</p>
