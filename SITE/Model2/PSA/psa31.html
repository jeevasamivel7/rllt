<h2> Psalms 31  </h2>

<h4> The Lord a Fortress in Adversity  </h4>
<h4> To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.  </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-1.htm">1</a>In You, O Lord, I put my trust;Let me never be ashamed;Deliver me in Your righteousness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-2.htm">2</a>Bow down Your ear to me,Deliver me speedily;Be my rock of refuge,A fortress of defense to save me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-3.htm">3</a>3For You are my rock and my fortress;Therefore, for Your name's sake,Lead me and guide me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-4.htm">4</a>Pull me out of the net which they have secretly laid for me,For You are my strength.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-5.htm">5</a>Into Your hand I commit my spirit;You have redeemed me, O Lord God of truth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-6.htm">6</a>I have hated those who regard useless idols;But I trust in the Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-7.htm">7</a>I will be glad and rejoice in Your mercy,For You have considered my trouble;You have known my soul in adversities,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-8.htm">8</a>And have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy;You have set my feet in a wide place.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-9.htm">9</a>Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am in trouble;My eye wastes away with grief,Yes, my soul and my body!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-10.htm">1o</a>For my life is spent with grief,And my years with sighing;My strength fails because of my iniquity,And my bones waste away.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-11.htm">11</a>I am a reproach among all my enemies,But especially among my neighbors,And am repulsive to my acquaintances;Those who see me outside flee from me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-12.htm">12</a>I am forgotten like a dead man, out of mind;I am like a broken vessel.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-13.htm">13</a>For I hear the slander of many;Fear is on every side;While they take counsel together against me,They scheme to take away my life.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-14.htm">14</a>But as for me, I trust in You, O Lord;I say, "You are my God."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-15.htm">15</a>My times are in Your hand;Deliver me from the hand of my enemies,And from those who persecute me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-16.htm">16</a>Make Your face shine upon Your servant;Save me for Your mercies' sake.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-17.htm">17</a>Do not let me be ashamed, O Lord, for I have called upon You;Let the wicked be ashamed;Let them be silent in the grave.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-18.htm">18</a>Let the lying lips be put to silence,Which speak insolent things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-19.htm">19</a>Oh, how great is Your goodness,Which You have laid up for those who fear You,Which You have prepared for those who trust in YouIn the presence of the sons of men!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-20.htm">20</a>You shall hide them in the secret place of Your presenceFrom the plots of man;You shall keep them secretly in a pavilionFrom the strife of tongues.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-21.htm">21</a>Blessed be the Lord,For He has shown me His marvelous kindness in a strong city!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-22.htm">22</a>For I said in my haste,"I am cut off from before Your eyes";Nevertheless You heard the voice of my supplicationsWhen I cried out to You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-23.htm">23</a>Oh, love the Lord, all you His saints!For the Lord preserves the faithful,And fully repays the proud person.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-24.htm">24</a>Be of good courage,And He shall strengthen your heart,All you who hope in the Lord.</p>
