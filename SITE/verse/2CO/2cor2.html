<h2>2Corinthians 2  </h2>
<h4> Paul Urges Forgiveness  </h4> 

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>But I determined this within myself, that I would not come again to you in sorrow. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>For if I make you sorrowful, then who is he who makes me glad but the one who is made sorrowful by me?</p>
<h4>  Forgive the Offender </h4> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>And I wrote this very thing to you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow over those from whom I ought to have joy, having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you, with many tears, not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have so abundantly for you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>But if anyone has caused grief, he has not grieved me, but all of you to some extent—not to be too severe. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>This punishment which was inflicted by the majority is sufficient for such a man, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>so that, on the contrary, you ought rather to forgive and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with too much sorrow. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love to him. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>For to this end I also wrote, that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Now whom you forgive anything, I also forgive. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>lest Satan should take advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices.</p>
<h4>  Triumph in Christ </h4>  
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ’s gospel, and a door was opened to me by the Lord, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I departed for Macedonia.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Now thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us diffuses the fragrance of His knowledge in every place. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>For we are to God the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>To the one we are the aroma of death leading to death, and to the other the aroma of life leading to life. And who is sufficient for these things? 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>For we are not, as so many, peddling the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as from God, we speak in the sight of God in Christ.</p>
