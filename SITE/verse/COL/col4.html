<h2>Colossians  4</h2>


<h4>Christian Graces; Final Greetings</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Masters, give your bondservants what is just and fair, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.</p>
<h4>Christian Graces</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Continue earnestly in prayer, being vigilant in it with thanksgiving;
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>meanwhile praying also for us, that God would open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in chains,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.</p>
<h4>Final Greetings</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Tychicus, a beloved brother, faithful minister, and fellow servant in the Lord, will tell you all the news about me.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>with Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you all things which are happening here.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, with Mark the cousin of Barnabas (about whom you received instructions: if he comes to you, welcome him),
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>and Jesus who is called Justus. These are my only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are of the circumcision; they have proved to be a comfort to me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Epaphras, who is one of you, a bondservant of Christ, greets you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>For I bear him witness that he has a great zeal for you, and those who are in Laodicea, and those in Hierapolis.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Luke the beloved physician and Demas greet you.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas and the church that is in his house.</p>
<h4>Closing Exhortations and Blessing</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Now when this epistle is read among you, see that it is read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and that you likewise read the epistle from Laodicea. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>And say to Archippus, “Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you may fulfill it.”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>This salutation by my own hand—Paul. Remember my chains. Grace be with you. Amen.</p>
