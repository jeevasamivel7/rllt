<h2> John 19 </h2>

<h4>The Soldiers Mock Jesus   </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>So then Pilate took Jesus and scourged Him.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>And the soldiers twisted a crown of thorns and put it on His head, and they put on Him a purple robe. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Then they said, "Hail, King of the Jews!" And they struck Him with their hands.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Pilate then went out again, and said to them, "Behold, I am bringing Him out to you, that you may know that I find no fault in Him."</p>
<h4>  Pilate's Decision </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Then Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, "Behold the Man!"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Therefore, when the chief priests and officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, "Crucify Him, crucify Him!"Pilate said to them, "You take Him and crucify Him, for I find no fault in Him."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and according to our law He ought to die, because He made Himself the Son of God."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Therefore, when Pilate heard that saying, he was the more afraid, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>and went again into the Praetorium, and said to Jesus,"Where are You from?" But Jesus gave him no answer.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Then Pilate said to Him, "Are You not speaking to me? Do You not know that I have power to crucify You, and power to release You?"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Jesus answered,<a style="color: #770000;"> "You could have no power at all against Me unless it had been given you from above. Therefore the one who delivered Me to you has the greater sin."</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>From then on Pilate sought to release Him, but the Jews cried out, saying, "If you let this Man go, you are not Caesar's friend. Whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus out and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, and about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, "Behold your King!"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>But they cried out, "Away with Him, away with Him! Crucify Him!"Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?"The chief priests answered, 'We have no king but Caesar!'</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Then he delivered Him to them to be crucified. Then they took Jesus and led Him away.</p>
<h4>  The King on a Cross </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>And He, bearing His cross, went out to a place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>where they crucified Him, and two others with Him, one on either side, and Jesus in the center. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Now Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross. And the writing was:</p>
<h4>  JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Then many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Therefore the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write, "The King of the Jews," but, 'He said, "I am the King of the Jews."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and also the tunic. Now the tunic was without seam, woven from the top in one piece. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>They said therefore among themselves, "Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be," that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says:"They divided My garments among them,And for My clothing they cast lots."Therefore the soldiers did these things.</p>
<h4> Behold Your Mother  </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother,<a style="color: #770000;"> "Woman, behold your son!"</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>Then He said to the disciple, <a style="color: #770000;">"Behold your mother!" </a>And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home.</p>
<h4> It Is Finished  </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, "I thirst!" 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>Now a vessel full of sour wine was sitting there; and they filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on hyssop, and put it to His mouth. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>So when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, <a style="color: #770000;">"It is finished!"</a> And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit.</p>
<h4>  Jesus Side Is Pierced </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>Therefore, because it was the Preparation Day, that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with Him. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a>And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you may believe. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-36.htm" target="_blank">36</a>For these things were done that the Scripture should be fulfilled, Not one of His bones shall be broken." 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-37.htm" target="_blank">37</a>And again another Scripture says, "They shall look on Him whom they pierced."</p>
<h4> Jesus Buried in Joseph's Tomb  </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-38.htm" target="_blank">38</a>After this, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took the body of Jesus. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-39.htm" target="_blank">39</a>And Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-40.htm" target="_blank">40</a>Then they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in strips of linen with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-41.htm" target="_blank">41</a>Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-42.htm" target="_blank">42</a>So there they laid Jesus, because of the Jews Preparation Day, for the tomb was nearby.</p>
