<h2> 1Corinthians 8 </h2>

<h4> Be Sensitive to Conscience  </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Now concerning things offered to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies. </p>
 <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>And if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know.
  <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>But if anyone loves God, this one is known by Him.</p>
 <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a> Therefore concerning the eating of things offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as there are many gods and many lords), 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>yet for us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and through whom we live.</p>
 <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>However, there is not in everyone that knowledge; for some, with consciousness of the idol, until now eat it as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
  <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a> But food does not commend us to God; for neither if we eat are we the better, nor if we do not eat are we the worse.</p>
<P> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>But beware lest somehow this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to those who are weak.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idolâ€™s temple, will not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat those things offered to idols?
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>And because of your knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a> But when you thus sin against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never again eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble.</p>
