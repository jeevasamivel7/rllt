<h2>2Thessalonians 3</h2>


<h4>Pray for Us</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run swiftly and be glorified, just as it is with you,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for not all have faith.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, both that you do and will do the things we command you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Now may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patience of Christ.
<h4> Warning Against Idleness</h4>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>But we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly and not according to the tradition which [a]he received from us.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>For you yourselves know how you ought to follow us, for we were not disorderly among you;
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>nor did we eat anyoneâ€™s bread free of charge, but worked with labor and toil night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a> not because we do not have authority, but to make ourselves an example of how you should follow us.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm" target="_blank">10</an>For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: If anyone will not work, neither shall he eat.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>For we hear that there are some who walk among you in a disorderly manner, not working at all, but are busybodies.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a></p>Now those who are such we command and exhort through our Lord Jesus Christ that they work in quietness and eat their own bread.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>But as for you, brethren, do not grow weary in doing good.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>And if anyone does not obey our word in this epistle, note that person and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Yet do not count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</p>
<h4> Benediction</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Now may the Lord of peace Himself give you peace always in every way. The Lord be with you all.
 <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is a sign in every epistle; so I write.
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
