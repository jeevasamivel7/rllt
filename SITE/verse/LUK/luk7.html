<h2>Luke 7 </h2>




<h4>Jesus Heals a Centurion's Servant</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-1.htm">1</a>Now when He concluded all His sayings in the hearing of the people, He entered Capernaum.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-2.htm">2</a>And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear to him, was sick and ready to die. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-3.htm">3</a>So when he heard about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to Him, pleading with Him to come and heal his servant. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-4.htm">4</a>And when they came to Jesus, they begged Him earnestly, saying that the one for whom He should do this was deserving,   
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-5.htm">5</a>'for he loves our nation, and has built us a synagogue.'   </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-6.htm">6</a>Then Jesus went with them. And when He was already not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him,'Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof.    </p>

 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-7.htm">7</a>Therefore I did not even think myself worthy to come to You. But say the word, and my servant will be healed.

 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-8.htm">8</a>For I also am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, "Come," and he comes; and to my servant, "Do this," and he does it.'   </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-9.htm">9</a>When Jesus heard these things, He marveled at him, and turned around and said to the crowd that followed Him,<a style="color:#770000;"> "I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!"</a>    </p>

 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-10.htm">10</a>And those who were sent, returning to the house, found the servant well who had been sick.   </p>


<h4>Jesus Raises the Son of the Widow of Nain   </h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-11.htm">11</a>Now it happened, the day after, that He went into a city called Nain; and many of His disciples went with Him, and a large crowd.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-12.htm">12</a>And when He came near the gate of the city, behold, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother; and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the city was with her.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-13.htm">13</a>When the Lord saw her, He had compassion on her and said to her,<a style="color:#770000;"> "Do not weep."</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-14.htm">14</a>Then He came and touched the open coffin, and those who carried him stood still. And He said, <a style="color:#770000;">"Young man, I say to you, arise.</a></p>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-15.htm">15</a>So he who was dead sat up and began to speak. And He presented him to his mother.   </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-16.htm">16</a>Then fearcame upon all, and they glorified God, saying, 'A great prophet has risen up among us'; and, 'God has visited His people." </p>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-17.htm">17</a>And this report about Him went throughout all Judea and all the surrounding region.</p>



<h4>John the Baptist Sends Messengers to Jesus </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-18.htm">18</a>Then the disciples of John reported to him concerning all these things.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-19.htm">19</a>And John, calling two of his disciples to him, sent them to Jesus, saying,"Are You the Coming One, or do we look for another?"  </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-20.htm">20</a>When the men had come to Him, they said, "John the Baptist has sent us to You, saying, "Are You the Coming One, or do we look for another?"'   </p>

 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-21.htm">21</a>And that very hour He cured many of infirmities, afflictions, and evil spirits; and to many blind He gave sight.   </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-22.htm">22</a>Jesus answered and said to them, <a style="color:#770000;">"Go and tell John the things you have seen and heard: that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the gospel preached to them.</a> 

<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-23.htm">23</a><a style="color:#770000;">And blessed is he who is not offended because of Me." </a>  </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-24.htm">24</a>When the messengers of John had departed, He began to speak to the multitudes concerning John:<a style="color:#770000;"> "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? </a> 

 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-25.htm">25</a><a style="color:#770000;">But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Indeed those who are gorgeously appareled and live in luxury are in kings" courts.</a>

<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-26.htm">26</a><a style="color:#770000;">But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet.</a> </p>
    

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-27.htm">27</a><a style="color:#770000;">This is he of whom it is written:"Behold, I send My messenger before Your face,Who will prepare Your way before You."</a> </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-28.htm">28</a><a style="color:#770000;">For I say to you, among those born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist; but he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</a>"</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-29.htm">29</a>And when all the people heard Him, even the tax collectors justified God, having been baptized with the baptism of John.    </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-30.htm">30</a>But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the will of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him.   </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-31.htm">31</a>And the Lord said,<a style="color:#770000;">"To what then shall I liken the men of this generation, and what are they like?</a></p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-32.htm">32</a><a style="color:#770000;">They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another, saying:"We played the flute for you,And you did not dance;We mourned to you,And you did not weep."</a> </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-33.htm">33</a><a style="color:#770000;">For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, "He has a demon." </a>   </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-34.htm">34</a><a style="color:#770000;"> The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, "Look, a glutton and a winebibber, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!"</a>   </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-35.htm">35</a><a style="color:#770000;">"But wisdom is justified by all her children."  </a> </p>

<h4>A Sinful Woman Forgiven </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-36.htm">36</a>Then one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And He went to the Pharisee's house, and sat down to eat.   </p> 

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-37.htm">37</a>And behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at the table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of fragrant oil,  </p>    
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-38.htm">38</a>and stood at His feet behind Him weeping; and she began to wash His feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head; and she kissed His feet and anointed them with the fragrant oil.    
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-39.htm">39</a>Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he spoke to himself, saying, "This Man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what manner of woman this is who is touching Him, for she is a sinner.'   </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-40.htm">40</a>And Jesus answered and said to him, 'Simon, I have something to say to you.So he said,'"Teacher, say it."   </p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-41.htm">41</a><a style="color:#770000;">"There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.</a>    
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-42.htm">42</a><a style="color:#770000;">And when they had nothing with which to repay, he freely forgave them both. Tell Me, therefore, which of them will love him more?'</a>   </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-43.htm">43</a>Simon answered and said, "I suppose the one whom he forgave more."And He said to him,<a style="color:#770000;"> "You have rightly judged."</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-44.htm">44</a>Then He turned to the woman and said to Simon, <a style="color:#770000;">"Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has washed My feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head.</a>   
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-45.htm">45</a><a style="color:#770000;">You gave Me no kiss, but this woman has not ceased to kiss My feet since the time I came in.</a>   
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-46.htm">46</a><a style="color:#770000;">You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has anointed My feet with fragrant oil.</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-47.htm">47</a><a style="color:#770000;">Therefore I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little." </a> </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-48.htm">48</a>Then He said to her,<a style="color:#770000;"> "Your sins are forgiven." </a>  </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-49.htm">49</a>And those who sat at the table with Him began to say to themselves,"Who is this who even forgives sins?"   </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-50.htm">50</a>Then He said to the woman,<a style="color:#770000;"> "Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.</a>'"</p>
