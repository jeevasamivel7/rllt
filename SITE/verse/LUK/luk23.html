<h2> Luke 23 </h2>


<h4>Jesus Handed Over to Pontius Pilate</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Then the whole multitude of them arose and led Him to Pilate. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>And they began to accuse Him, saying, "We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, saying that He Himself is Christ, a King."</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Then Pilate asked Him, saying, "Are You the King of the Jews?"He answered him and said,<a style="color:#770000;">"It is as you say."</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>So Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, "I find no fault in this Man."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>But they were the more fierce, saying,"He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place."</p>


<h4>Jesus Faces Herod</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked if the Man were a Galilean.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>And as soon as he knew that He belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad; for he had desired for a long time to see Him, because he had heard many things about Him, and he hoped to see some miracle done by Him.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Then he questioned Him with many words, but He answered him nothing.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused Him.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Then Herod, with his men of war, treated Him with contempt and mocked Him, arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe, and sent Him back to Pilate.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>That very day Pilate and Herod became friends with each other, for previously they had been at enmity with each other.</p>


<h4>Taking the Place of Barabbas</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Then Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>said to them,"You have brought this Man to me, as one who misleads the people. And indeed, having examined Him in your presence, I have found no fault in this Man concerning those things of which you accuse Him;
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>no, neither did Herod, for I sent you back to him; and indeed nothing deserving of death has been done by Him. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>I will therefore chastise Him and release Him"
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>(for it was necessaryfor him to release one to them at feast)</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a> And they all cried out at once, saying, "Away with this Man, and release to us Barabbas"-
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>who had been thrown into prison for a certain rebellion made in the city, and for murder.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Pilate, therefore, wishing to release Jesus, again called out to them. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>But they shouted, saying,"Crucify Him, crucify Him!"</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Then he said to them the third time, "Why, what evil has He done? I have found no reason for death in Him. I will therefore chastise Him and let Him go."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices that He be crucified. And the voices of these men and of the chief priests prevailed.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>So Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they requested.</p>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>And he released to them the one they requested, who for rebellion and murder had been thrown into prison; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</p>


<h4>The King on a Cross</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>Now as they led Him away, they laid hold of a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian, who was coming from the country, and on him they laid the cross that he might bear it after Jesus.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>And a great multitude of the people followed Him, and women who also mourned and lamented Him.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>But Jesus, turning to them, said,<a style="color:#770000;">"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.,</a></p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a><a style="color:#770000;"> For indeed the days are coming in which they will say, "Blessed are the barren, wombs that never bore, and breasts which never nursed!",</a>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a><a style="color:#770000;">Then they will begin "to say to the mountains,"Fall on us!" and to the hills,"Cover us!'"</a></p> 


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a><a style="color:#770000;">For if they do these things in the green wood, what will be done in the dry?"</a>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>There were also two others, criminals, led with Him to be put to death. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>And when they had come to the place called Calvary, there they crucified Him, and the criminals, one on the right hand and the other on the left.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a> Then Jesus said,<a style="color:#770000;"> "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do."</a> And they divided His garments and cast lots.</p>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a>And the people stood looking on. But even the rulers with them sneered, saying,"He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ, the chosen of God."</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-36.htm" target="_blank">36</a>The soldiers also mocked Him, coming and offering Him sour wine, 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-37.htm" target="_blank">37</a>and saying, "If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself."</p>




<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-38.htm" target="_blank">38</a>And an inscription also was written over Him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew:THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>

<h4>The King on a Cross</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-39.htm" target="_blank">39</a>Then one of the criminals who were hanged blasphemed Him, saying, "If You are the Christ, save Yourself and us."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-40.htm" target="_blank">40</a>But the other, answering, rebuked him, saying, "Do you not even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-41.htm" target="_blank">41</a>And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this Man has done nothing wrong."
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-42.htm" target="_blank">42</a>Then he said to Jesus,"Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-43.htm" target="_blank">43</a>And Jesus said to him,<a style="color:#770000;"> "Assuredly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in Paradise."</a></p>


<h4>Jesus Dies on the Cross</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-44.htm" target="_blank">44</a>Now it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-45.htm" target="_blank">45</a>Then the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-46.htm" target="_blank">46</a>And when Jesus had cried out with a loud voice, He said,<a style="color:#770000;"> "Father,"into Your hands I commit My spirit.'"</a> Having said this, He breathed His last.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-47.htm" target="_blank">47</a>So when the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying, "Certainly this was a righteous Man!"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-48.htm" target="_blank">48</a>And the whole crowd who came together to that sight, seeing what had been done, beat their breasts and returned.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-49.htm" target="_blank">49</a>But all His acquaintances, and the women who followed Him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.</p>

<h4>Jesus Buried in Joseph's Tomb</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-50.htm" target="_blank">50</a>Now behold, there was a man named Joseph, a council member, a good and just man.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-51.htm" target="_blank">51</a>He had not consented to their decision and deed. He was from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who himself was also waiting for the kingdom of God.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-52.htm" target="_blank">52</a>This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-53.htm" target="_blank">53</a>Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a tomb that was hewn out of the rock, where no one had ever lain before. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-54.htm" target="_blank">54</a>That day was the Preparation, and the Sabbath drew near.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-55.htm" target="_blank">55</a>And the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed after, and they observed the tomb and how His body was laid.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-56.htm" target="_blank">56</a>Then they returned and prepared spices and fragrant oils. And they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment.</p>
