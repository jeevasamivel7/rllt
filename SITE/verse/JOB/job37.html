<h2> Job 37 </h2>


<h4>God's Works and Wisdom</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>"At this also my heart trembles,And leaps from its place.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Hear attentively the thunder of His voice,And the rumbling that comes from His mouth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>He sends it forth under the whole heaven,His lightning to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>After it a voice roars;He thunders with His majestic voice,And He does not restrain them when His voice is heard.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>God thunders marvelously with His voice;He does great things which we cannot comprehend.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>For He says to the snow, "Fall on the earth";Likewise to the gentle rain and the heavy rain of His strength.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>He seals the hand of every man,That all men may know His work.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>The beasts go into dens,And remain in their lairs.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>From the chamber of the south comes the whirlwind,And cold from the scattering winds of the north.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>By the breath of God ice is given,And the broad waters are frozen.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Also with moisture He saturates the thick clouds;He scatters His bright clouds.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>And they swirl about, being turned by His guidance,That they may do whatever He commands them On the face of the whole earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>He causes it to come,Whether for correction,Or for His land,Or for mercy.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>"Listen to this, O Job;Stand still and consider the wondrous works of God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Do you know when God dispatches them,And causes the light of His cloud to shine?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Do you know how the clouds are balanced,Those wondrous works of Him who is perfect in knowledge?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Why are your garments hot,When He quiets the earth by the south wind?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>With Him, have you spread out the skies,Strong as a cast metal mirror?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>"Teach us what we should say to Him,For we can prepare nothing because of the darkness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Should He be told that I wish to speak?If a man were to speak, surely he would be swallowed up.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Even now men cannot look at the light when it is bright in the skies,When the wind has passed and cleared them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>He comes from the north as golden splendor;With God is awesome majesty.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>As for the Almighty, we cannot find Him;He is excellent in power,In judgment and abundant justice;He does not oppress.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>Therefore men fear Him;He shows no partiality to any who are wise of heart."</p>
