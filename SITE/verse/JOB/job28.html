<h2> Job 28 </h2>


<h4>Job's Discourse on Wisdom</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>"Surely there is a mine for silver,And a place where gold is refined.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Iron is taken from the earth,And copper is smelted from ore.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Man puts an end to darkness,And searches every recessFor ore in the darkness and the shadow of death.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>He breaks open a shaft away from people;In places forgotten by feetThey hang far away from men;They swing to and fro.
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>As for the earth, from it comes bread,But underneath it is turned up as by fire;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Its stones are the source of sapphires,And it contains gold dust.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>That path no bird knows,Nor has the falcon's eye seen it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>The proud lions have not trodden it,Nor has the fierce lion passed over it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>He puts his hand on the flint;He overturns the mountains at the roots.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>He cuts out channels in the rocks,And his eye sees every precious thing.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>He dams up the streams from trickling;What is hidden he brings forth to light.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>"But where can wisdom be found?And where is the place of understanding?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Man does not know its value,Nor is it found in the land of the living.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>The deep says, 'It is not in me';And the sea says, 'It is not with me.'</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>It cannot be purchased for gold,Nor can silver be weighed for its price.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir,In precious onyx or sapphire.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Neither gold nor crystal can equal it,Nor can it be exchanged for jewelry of fine gold.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>No mention shall be made of coral or quartz,For the price of wisdom is above rubies.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it,Nor can it be valued in pure gold.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>"From where then does wisdom come?And where is the place of understanding?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>It is hidden from the eyes of all living,And concealed from the birds of the air.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Destruction and Death say,'We have heard a report about it with our ears.'</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>God understands its way,And He knows its place.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>For He looks to the ends of the earth,And sees under the whole heavens,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>To establish a weight for the wind,And apportion the waters by measure.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>When He made a law for the rain,And a path for the thunderbolt,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>Then He saw wisdom and declared it;He prepared it, indeed, He searched it out.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>And to man He said,'Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom,And to depart from evil is understanding.'"</p>
