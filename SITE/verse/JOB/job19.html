<h2> Job 19 </h2>


<h4>Job Trusts in His Redeemer</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Then Job answered and said:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>"How long will you torment my soul,And break me in pieces with words?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>These ten times you have reproached me;You are not ashamed that you have wronged me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>And if indeed I have erred,My error remains with me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>If indeed you exalt yourselves against me,And plead my disgrace against me,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Know then that God has wronged me,And has surrounded me with His net.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>"If I cry out concerning wrong, I am not heard.If I cry aloud, there is no justice.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>He has fenced up my way, so that I cannot pass;And He has set darkness in my paths.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>He has stripped me of my glory,And taken the crown from my head.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>He breaks me down on every side,And I am gone;My hope He has uprooted like a tree.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>He has also kindled His wrath against me,And He counts me as one of His enemies.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>His troops come togetherAnd build up their road against me;They encamp all around my tent.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>"He has removed my brothers far from me,And my acquaintances are completely estranged from me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>My relatives have failed,And my close friends have forgotten me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Those who dwell in my house, and my maidservants,Count me as a stranger;I am an alien in their sight.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>I call my servant, but he gives no answer;I beg him with my mouth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>My breath is offensive to my wife,And I am repulsive to the children of my own body.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Even young children despise me;I arise, and they speak against me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>All my close friends abhor me,And those whom I love have turned against me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh,And I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>"Have pity on me, have pity on me, O you my friends,For the hand of God has struck me!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Why do you persecute me as God does,And are not satisfied with my flesh?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>"Oh, that my words were written!Oh, that they were inscribed in a book!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>That they were engraved on a rockWith an iron pen and lead, forever!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>For I know that my Redeemer lives,And He shall stand at last on the earth;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>And after my skin is destroyed, this I know,That in my flesh I shall see God,</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>Whom I shall see for myself,And my eyes shall behold, and not another.How my heart yearns within me!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>If you should say,"How shall we persecute him?'"Since the root of the matter is found in me,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>Be afraid of the sword for yourselves;For wrath brings the punishment of the sword,That you may know there is a judgment."</p>
