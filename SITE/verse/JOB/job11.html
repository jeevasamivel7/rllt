<h2> Job 11 </h2>


<h4>Zophar Urges Job to Repent</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>"Should not the multitude of words be answered?And should a man full of talk be vindicated?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Should your empty talk make men [b]hold their peace?And when you mock, should no one rebuke you?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>For you have said,"My doctrine is pure,And I am clean in your eyes.'</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>But oh, that God would speak,And open His lips against you,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>That He would show you the secrets of wisdom!For they would double your prudence.Know therefore that God exacts from youLess than your iniquity deserves.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>"Can you search out the deep things of God?Can you find out the limits of the Almighty?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>They are higher than heaven-what can you do?Deeper than Sheol-what can you know?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Their measure is longer than the earthAnd broader than the sea.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>"If He passes by, imprisons, and gathers to judgment,Then who can hinder Him?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>For He knows deceitful men;He sees wickedness also.Will He not then consider it?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>For an empty-headed man will be wise,When a wild donkey's colt is born a man.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>"If you would prepare your heart,And stretch out your hands toward Him;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>If iniquity were in your hand, and you put it far away,And would not let wickedness dwell in your tents;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Then surely you could lift up your face without spot;Yes, you could be steadfast, and not fear;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Because you would forget your misery,And remember it as waters that have passed away,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>And your life would be brighter than noonday.Though you were dark, you would be like the morning.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>And you would be secure, because there is hope;Yes, you would dig around you, and take your rest in safety.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>You would also lie down, and no one would make you afraid;Yes, many would court your favor.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>But the eyes of the wicked will fail,And they shall not escape,And their hope-loss of life!'!</p>
