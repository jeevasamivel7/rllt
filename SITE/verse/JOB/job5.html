<h2> Job 5 </h2>


<h4>Eliphaz: Job Is Chastened by God</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>"Call out now;Is there anyone who will answer you?And to which of the holy ones will you turn?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>For wrath kills a foolish man,And envy slays a simple one.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>I have seen the foolish taking root,But suddenly I cursed his dwelling place.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>His sons are far from safety,They are crushed in the gate,And there is no deliverer.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a></p>Because the hungry eat up his harvest,Taking it even from the thorns,
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a></p>For affliction does not come from the dust,Nor does trouble spring from the ground;,/p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Yet man is born to trouble,As the sparks fly upward.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>"But as for me, I would seek God,And to God I would commit my cause-</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Who does great things, and unsearchable,Marvelous things without number.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>He gives rain on the earth,And sends waters on the fields.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>He sets on high those who are lowly,And those who mourn are lifted to safety.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>He frustrates the devices of the crafty,So that their hands cannot carry out their plans.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>He catches the wise in their own craftiness,And the counsel of the cunning comes quickly upon them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>They meet with darkness in the daytime,And grope at noontime as in the night.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>But He saves the needy from the sword,From the mouth of the mighty,And from their hand.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>So the poor have hope,And injustice shuts her mouth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>"Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects;Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>For He bruises, but He binds up;He wounds, but His hands make whole.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>He shall deliver you in six troubles,Yes, in seven no evil shall touch you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>In famine He shall redeem you from death,And in war from the power of the sword.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,And you shall not be afraid of destruction when it comes.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>You shall laugh at destruction and famine,And you shall not be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>For you shall have a covenant with the stones of the field,And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>You shall know that your tent is in peace;You shall visit your dwelling and find nothing amiss.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>You shall also know that your descendants shall be many,And your offspring like the grass of the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>You shall come to the grave at a full age,As a sheaf of grain ripens in its season.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>Behold, this we have searched out;It is true.Hear it, and know for yourself."</p>
