<h2> Job 3 </h2>


<h4>Job Deplores His Birth</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>And Job spoke, and said:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>"May the day perish on which I was born,And the night in which it was said,"A male child is conceived."
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>May that day be darkness;May God above not seek it,Nor the light shine upon it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>May darkness and the shadow of death claim it;May a cloud settle on it;May the blackness of the day terrify it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>As for that night, may darkness seize it;May it not rejoice among the days of the year,May it not come into the number of the months.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Oh, may that night be barren!May no joyful shout come into it!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>May those curse it who curse the day,Those who are ready to arouse Leviathan.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>May the stars of its morning be dark;May it look for light, but have none,And not see the dawning of the day;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Because it did not shut up the doors of my mother's womb,Nor hide sorrow from my eyes.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>"Why did I not die at birth?Why did I not perish when I came from the womb?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Why did the knees receive me?Or why the breasts, that I should nurse?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>For now I would have lain still and been quiet,I would have been asleep;Then I would have been at rest</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>With kings and counselors of the earth,Who built ruins for themselves,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Or with princes who had gold,Who filled their houses with silver;,/p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Or why was I not hidden like a stillborn child,Like infants who never saw light?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>There the wicked cease from troubling,And there the weary are arest.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>There the prisoners rest together;They do not hear the voice of the oppressor.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>The small and great are there,And the servant is free from his master.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>"Why is light given to him who is in misery,And life to the bitter of soul,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Who long for death, but it does not come,And search for it more than hidden treasures;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Who rejoice exceedingly,And are glad when they can find the grave?
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden,And whom God has hedged in?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>For my sighing comes before I eat,And my groanings pour out like water.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>For the thing I greatly feared has come upon me,And what I dreaded has happened to me.
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>I am not at ease, nor am I quiet;I have no rest, for trouble comes."</p>
