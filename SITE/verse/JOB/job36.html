<h2> Job 36 </h2>


<h4>Elihu Proclaims God's Goodness</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Elihu also proceeded and said:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>"Bear with me a little, and I will show youThat there are yet words to speak on God's behalf.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>I will fetch my knowledge from afar;I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>For truly my words are not false;One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>"Behold, God is mighty, but despises no one;He is mighty in strength of understanding.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>He does not preserve the life of the wicked,But gives justice to the oppressed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous;But they are on the throne with kings,For He has seated them forever,And they are exalted.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>And if they are bound in fetters,Held in the cords of affliction,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Then He tells them their work and their transgressions"That they have acted defiantly.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>He also opens their ear to instruction,And commands that they turn from iniquity.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>If they obey and serve Him,They shall spend their days in prosperity,And their years in pleasures.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>But if they do not obey,They shall perish by the sword,And they shall die without knowledge.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>"But the hypocrites in heart store up wrath;They do not cry for help when He binds them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>They die in youth,And their life ends among the perverted persons.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>He delivers the poor in their affliction,And opens their ears in oppression.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>"Indeed He would have brought you out of dire distress,Into a broad place where there is no restraint;And what is set on your table would be full of richness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>But you are filled with the judgment due the wicked;Judgment and justice take hold of you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Because there is wrath, beware lest He take you away with one blow;For a large ransom would not help you avoid it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Will your riches,Or all the mighty forces,Keep you from distress?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Do not desire the night,When people are cut off in their place.
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Take heed, do not turn to iniquity,For you have chosen this rather than affliction.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>"Behold, God is exalted by His power;Who teaches like Him?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Who has assigned Him His way,Or who has said, "You have done wrong'?</p>

<h4> Elihu Proclaims God's Majesty</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>"Remember to magnify His work,Of which men have sung.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Everyone has seen it;Man looks on it from afar.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>"Behold, God is great, and we do not know Him;Nor can the number of His years be discovered.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>For He draws up drops of water,Which distill as rain from the mist,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>Which the clouds drop downAnd pour abundantly on man.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>Indeed, can anyone understand the spreading of clouds,The thunder from His canopy?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>Look, He scatters His light upon it,And covers the depths of the sea.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>For by these He judges the peoples;He gives food in abundance.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>He covers His hands with lightning,And commands it to strike.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>His thunder declares it,The cattle also, concerning the rising storm.</p>
