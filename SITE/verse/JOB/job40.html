<h2> Job 40 </h2>


<h4>God's Power and Wisdom</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Moreover the Lord answered Job, and said:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>"Shall the one who contends with the Almighty correct Him?He who rebukes God, let him answer it."</p>


<h4>Job's Response to God</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Then Job answered the Lord and said:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>"Behold, I am vile;What shall I answer You?I lay my hand over my mouth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Once I have spoken, but I will not answer;Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further."</p>


<h4>God's Challenge to Job</h4>





<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>"Now prepare yourself like a man;I will question you, and you shall answer Me:</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>"Would you indeed annul My judgment?Would you condemn Me that you may be justified?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Have you an arm like God?Or can you thunder with a voice like His?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Then adorn yourself with majesty and splendor,And array yourself with glory and beauty.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Disperse the rage of your wrath;Look on everyone who is proud, and humble him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Look on everyone who is proud, and bring him low;Tread down the wicked in their place.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Hide them in the dust together,Bind their faces in hidden darkness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Then I will also confess to youThat your own right hand can save you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Look now at the behemoth, which I made along with you;He eats grass like an ox.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>See now, his strength is in his hips,And his power is in his stomach muscles.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>He moves his tail like a cedar;The sinews of his thighs are tightly knit.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>His bones are like beams of bronze,His ribs like bars of iron.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>He is the first of the ways of God;Only He who made him can bring near His sword.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Surely the mountains yield food for him,And all the beasts of the field play there.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>He lies under the lotus trees,In a covert of reeds and marsh.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>The lotus trees cover him with their shade;The willows by the brook surround him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Indeed the river may rage,Yet he is not disturbed;He is confident, though the Jordan gushes into his mouth,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>Though he takes it in his eyes,Or one pierces his nose with a snare.</p>
