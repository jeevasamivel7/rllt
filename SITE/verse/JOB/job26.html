<h2> Job 26 </h2>


<h4>Job: Man's Frailty and God's Majesty</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>But Job answered and said:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>"How have you helped him who is without power?How have you saved the arm that has no strength?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>How have you counseled one who has no wisdom?And how have you declared sound advice to many?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>To whom have you uttered words?And whose spirit came from you?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>"The dead tremble,Those under the waters and those inhabiting them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Sheol is naked before Him,And Destruction has no covering.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>He stretches out the north over empty space;He hangs the earth on nothing.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>He binds up the water in His thick clouds,Yet the clouds are not broken under it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>He covers the face of His throne,And spreads His cloud over it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>He drew a circular horizon on the face of the waters,At the boundary of light and darkness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>The pillars of heaven tremble,And are astonished at His rebuke.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>He stirs up the sea with His power,And by His understanding He breaks up the storm.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>By His Spirit He adorned the heavens;His hand pierced the fleeing serpent.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Indeed these are the mere edges of His ways,And how small a whisper we hear of Him!But the thunder of His power who can understand?"</p>
