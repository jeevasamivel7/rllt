<h2> Job 39 </h2>


<h4>God Continues to Challenge Job</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>"Do you know the time when the wild mountain goats bear young?Or can you mark when the deer gives birth?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Can you number the months that they fulfill?Or do you know the time when they bear young?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>They bow down,They bring forth their young,They deliver their offspring.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Their young ones are healthy,They grow strong with grain;They depart and do not return to them.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>"Who set the wild donkey free?Who loosed the bonds of the onager,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Whose home I have made the wilderness,And the barren land his dwelling?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>He scorns the tumult of the city;He does not heed the shouts of the driver.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>The range of the mountains is his pasture,And he searches after every green thing.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>"Will the wild ox be willing to serve you?Will he bed by your manger?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Can you bind the wild ox in the furrow with ropes?Or will he plow the valleys behind you?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Will you trust him because his strength is great?Or will you leave your labor to him?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Will you trust him to bring home your grain,And gather it to your threshing floor?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>"The wings of the ostrich wave proudly,But are her wings and pinions like the kindly stork's?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>For she leaves her eggs on the ground,And warms them in the dust;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>She forgets that a foot may crush them,Or that a wild beast may break them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>She treats her young harshly, as though they were not hers;Her labor is in vain, without concern,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Because God deprived her of wisdom,And did not endow her with understanding.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>When she lifts herself on high,She scorns the horse and its rider.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>"Have you given the horse strength?Have you clothed his neck with thunder?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Can you frighten him like a locust?His majestic snorting strikes terror.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength;He gallops into the clash of arms.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>He mocks at fear, and is not frightened;Nor does he turn back from the sword.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>The quiver rattles against him,The glittering spear and javelin.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>He devours the distance with fierceness and rage;Nor does he come to a halt because the trumpet has sounded.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>At the blast of the trumpet he says, 'Aha!'He smells the battle from afar,The thunder of captains and shouting.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>"Does the hawk fly by your wisdom,And spread its wings toward the south?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>Does the eagle mount up at your command,And make its nest on high?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>On the rock it dwells and resides,On the crag of the rock and the stronghold.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>From there it spies out the prey;Its eyes observe from afar.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>Its young ones suck up blood;And where the slain are, there it is."</p>
