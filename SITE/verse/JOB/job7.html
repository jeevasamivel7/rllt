<h2> Job 7 </h2>


<h4>Job: My Suffering Is Comfortless</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>"Is there not a time of hard service for man on earth?Are not his days also like the days of a hired man?</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Like a servant who earnestly desires the shade,And like a hired man who eagerly looks for his wages,</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>So I have been allotted months of futility,And wearisome nights have been appointed to me.</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>When I lie down, I say,'When shall I arise,And the night be ended?'For I have had my fill of tossing till dawn.</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>My flesh is caked with worms and dust,My skin is cracked and breaks out afresh.</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>"My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle,And are spent without hope.</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Oh, remember that my life is a breath!My eye will never again see good.</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>The eye of him who sees me will see me no more;While your eyes are upon me, I shall no longer be.</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>As the cloud disappears and vanishes away,So he who goes down to the grave does not come up.</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>He shall never return to his house,Nor shall his place know him anymore.</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>"Therefore I will not restrain my mouth;I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Am I a sea, or a sea serpent,That You set a guard over me?</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>When I say, 'My bed will comfort me,My couch will ease my complaint,'</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Then You scare me with dreamsAnd terrify me with visions,</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>So that my soul chooses stranglingAnd death rather than my body.</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>I loathe my life;I would not live forever.Let me alone,For my days are but a breath.</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>"What is man, that You should exalt him,That You should set Your heart on him,</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>That You should visit him every morning,And test him every moment?</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>How long?Will You not look away from me,And let me alone till I swallow my saliva?</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Have I sinned?What have I done to You, O watcher of men?Why have You set me as Your target,So that I am a burden to myself?</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Why then do You not pardon my transgression,And take away my iniquity?For now I will lie down in the dust,And You will seek me diligently,But I will no longer be."</P>
