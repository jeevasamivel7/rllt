<h2> John 16 </h2>
    
    <h4>Jesus Warns and Comforts His Disciples</h4>
    
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a><a style="color: #770000">“These things I have spoken to you, that you should not be made to stumble.</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a><a style="color: #770000">They will put you out of the synagogues; yes, the time is coming that whoever kills you will think that he offers God service.</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a><a style="color: #770000">And these things they will do to you because they have not known the Father nor Me.</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a><a style="color: #770000">But these things I have told you, that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you of them.<br>“And these things I did not say to you at the beginning, because I was with you.</a>
    </p>
    <h4>The Work of the Holy Spirit</h4>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a><a style="color: #770000">“But now I go away to Him who sent Me, and none of you asks Me, ‘Where are You going?’</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a><a style="color: #770000">But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a><a style="color: #770000">Nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is to your advantage that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you.</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a><a style="color: #770000">And when He has come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a><a style="color: #770000">of sin, because they do not believe in Me; </a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a><a style="color: #770000">of righteousness, because I go to My Father and you see Me no more;</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a><a style="color: #770000">of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.</a>
</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a><a style="color: #770000">“I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. </a>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a><a style="color: #770000">However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come. </a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a><a style="color: #770000">He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you.</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a><a style="color: #770000">All things that the Father has are Mine. Therefore I said that He will take of Mine and declare it to you.</a>
</p>
<h4>Sorrow Will Turn to Joy</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a><a style="color: #770000">“A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me, because I go to the Father.”</a></p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Then some of His disciples said among themselves, “What is this that He says to us,<a style="color: #770000"> ‘A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me’; and, ‘because I go to the Father’?”</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>They said therefore, “What is this that He says, <a style="color: #770000">‘A little while’</a>? We do not know what He is saying.”
</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Now Jesus knew that they desired to ask Him, and He said to them, <a style="color: #770000">“Are you inquiring among yourselves about what I said, ‘A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me’?</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a><a style="color: #770000">Most assuredly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; and you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a><a style="color: #770000">A woman, when she is in labor, has sorrow because her hour has come; but as soon as she has given birth to the child, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a human being has been born into the world. </a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a><a style="color: #770000">Therefore you now have sorrow; but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice, and your joy no one will take from you.</a>
</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a><a style="color: #770000">“And in that day you will ask Me nothing. Most assuredly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you.</a>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a><a style="color: #770000">Until now you have asked nothing in My name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.</a>
</p>
<h4>Jesus Christ Has Overcome the World</h4>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a><a style="color: #770000">“These things I have spoken to you in figurative language; but the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figurative language, but I will tell you plainly about the Father.</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a><a style="color: #770000">In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you;</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a><a style="color: #770000">for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me, and have believed that I came forth from God.</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a><a style="color: #770000">I came forth from the Father and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world and go to the Father.”</a>
</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>His disciples said to Him, “See, now You are speaking plainly, and using no figure of speech!
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>Now we are sure that You know all things, and have no need that anyone should question You. By this we believe that You came forth from God.”
</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a> Jesus answered them, <a style="color: #770000">“Do you now believe?</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-33.htm" target="_blank">32</a><a style="color: #770000">Indeed the hour is coming, yes, has now come, that you will be scattered, each to his own, and will leave Me alone. And yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me. </a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a><a style="color: #770000">These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.”</a> </p>
