    <h2> John 14 </h2>
    
    <h4>The Way, the Truth, and the Life</h4>
    
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a><a style="color: #770000">"Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me.</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a><a style="color: #770000">In My Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a><a style="color: #770000">And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also.</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a><a style="color: #770000">And where I go you know, and the way you know.”</a></p>
   <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Thomas said to Him, “Lord, we do not know where You are going, and how can we know the way?”</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Jesus said to him, <a style="color: #770000"></a>“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.</a></p>
    <h4>The Father Revealed</h4>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a><a style="color: #770000">“If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and from now on you know Him and have seen Him.”</a>
    </p> 
     <p>  <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Philip said to Him, “Lord, show us the Father, and it is sufficient for us.”
    </p> 
     <p>  <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a> said to him,<a style="color: #770000">Jesus “Have I been with you so long, and yet you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; so how can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a><a style="color: #770000">Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? The words that I speak to you I do not speak on My own authority; but the Father who dwells in Me does the works. </a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a><a style="color: #770000">Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me, or else believe Me for the sake of the works themselves.</a>
</p> 
<h4>The Answered Prayer</h4>
    <p>   <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a><a style="color: #770000">“Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father.</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a><a style="color: #770000">And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. </a>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a><a style="color: #770000">If you ask anything in My name, I will do it.</a></p> 
<h4>Jesus Promises Another Helper</h4>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a><a style="color: #770000">“If you love Me, keep My commandments.</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a><a style="color: #770000">And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you forever— </a></p>
    <p>  <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a><a style="color: #770000">the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be in you. </a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a><a style="color: #770000">I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you.</a></p> 
  <h4> Indwelling of the Father and the Son</h4>
    <p></p>  <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a><a style="color: #770000">“A little while longer and the world will see Me no more, but you will see Me. Because I live, you will live also.</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a><a style="color: #770000">At that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a><a style="color: #770000">He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and manifest Myself to him.”</a></p> 
<p>   <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Judas (not Iscariot) said to Him, “Lord, how is it that You will manifest Yourself to us, and not to the world?”
</p> 
   <p>  <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Jesus answered and said to him,<a style="color: #770000"></a> “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him. </a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a><a style="color: #770000">He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine but the Father’s who sent Me.</a>
</p> 
 <h4> The Gift of His Peace</h4>
    <p>   <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a><a style="color: #770000">“These things I have spoken to you while being present with you.</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a><a style="color: #770000">But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you.</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a><a style="color: #770000">Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a><a style="color: #770000">You have heard Me say to you, ‘I am going away and coming back to you.’ If you loved Me, you would rejoice because I said, ‘I am going to the Father,’ for My Father is greater than I.</a>
</p> 

<p>  <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a><a style="color: #770000">“And now I have told you before it comes, that when it does come to pass, you may believe.</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a><a style="color: #770000">I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming, and he has nothing in Me.</a>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a><a style="color: #770000">But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave Me commandment, so I do. Arise, let us go from here.</a>
