<h2> John 12 </h2>


<h4>The Anointing at Bethany</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was who had been dead, whom He had raised from the dead.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>There they made Him a supper; and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with Him. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Then Mary took a pound of very costly oil of spikenard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the oil.</p>




<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, who would betray Him, said, </p>
 <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>"Why was this fragrant oil not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?"
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>But Jesus said,<a style="color:#770000;"> "Let her alone; she has kept this for the day of My burial.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a><a style="color:#770000;">For the poor you have with you always, but Me you do not have always."</a></p>


<h4>The Plot to Kill Lazarus</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Now a great many of the Jews knew that He was there; and they came, not for Jesus" sake only, but that they might also see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>But the chief priests plotted to put Lazarus to death also,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.</p>



<h4>The Triumphal Entry</h4>





<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>The next day a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Him, and cried out:"Hosanna!"Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!"The King of Israel!"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Then Jesus, when He had found a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>"Fear not, daughter of Zion;Behold, your King is coming,Sitting on a donkey's colt."</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about Him and that they had done these things to Him.</p>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a> Therefore the people, who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of his tomb and raised him from the dead, bore witness. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>For this reason the people also met Him, because they heard that He had done this sign. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, "You see that you are accomplishing nothing. Look, the world has gone after Him!"</p>


<h4>The Fruitful Grain of Wheat</h4>




<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Now there were certain Greeks among those who came up to worship at the feast. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Then they came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying,"Sir, we wish to see Jesus."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a><a style="color:#770000;">But Jesus answered them, saying, "The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a><a style="color:#770000;">Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a><a style="color:#770000;">He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a><a style="color:#770000;">If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also. If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor.</a></p>



<h4>Jesus Predicts His Death on the Cross</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a><a style="color:#770000;">"Now My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? "Father, save Me from this hour"? But for this purpose I came to this hour.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a><a style="color:#770000;">Father, glorify Your name.</a>"Then a voice came from heaven, saying, "I have both glorified it and will glorify it again."</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>Therefore the people who stood by and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, "An angel has spoken to Him."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>Jesus answered and said,<a style="color:#770000;"> "This voice did not come because of Me, but for your sake. </a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a><a style="color:#770000;">Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all peoples to Myself."
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>This He said, signifying by what death He would die.</p>




<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>The people answered Him, "We have heard from the law that the Christ remains forever; and how can You say,<a style="color:#770000;"> "The Son of Man must be lifted up"?</a> Who is this Son of Man?"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a>Then Jesus said to them,<a style="color:#770000;"> "A little while longer the light is with you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you; he who walks in darkness does not know where he is going. </a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-36.htm" target="_blank">36</a><a style="color:#770000;">While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light."</a> These things Jesus spoke, and departed, and was hidden from them.




<h4>Who Has Believed Our Report?</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-37.htm" target="_blank">37</a>But although He had done so many signs before them, they did not believe in Him,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-38.htm" target="_blank">38</a>that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke:"Lord, who has believed our report?And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"</p>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-39.htm" target="_blank">39</a>Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-40.htm" target="_blank">40</a>"He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts,Lest they should see with their eyes,Lest they should understand with their hearts and turn,So that I should heal them."</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-41.htm" target="_blank">41</a>These things Isaiah said when he saw His glory and spoke of Him.


<h4>Walk in the Light</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-42.htm" target="_blank">42</a>Nevertheless even among the rulers many believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue; 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-43.htm" target="_blank">43</a>for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-44.htm" target="_blank">44</a>Then Jesus cried out and said,<a style="color:#770000;"> "He who believes in Me, believes not in Me but in Him who sent Me.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-45.htm" target="_blank">45</a><a style="color:#770000;">And he who sees Me sees Him who sent Me.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-46.htm" target="_blank">46</a><a style="color:#770000;">I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in Me should not abide in darkness.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-47.htm" target="_blank">47</a><a style="color:#770000;">And if anyone hears My words and does not believe, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-48.htm" target="_blank">48</a><a style="color:#770000;">He who rejects Me, and does not receive My words, has that which judges him"the word that I have spoken will judge him in the last day. </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-49.htm" target="_blank">49</a><a style="color:#770000;">For I have not spoken on My own authority; but the Father who sent Me gave Me a command, what I should say and what I should speak.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-50.htm" target="_blank">50</a><a style="color:#770000;">And I know that His command is everlasting life. Therefore, whatever I speak, just as the Father has told Me, so I speak.</a></p>
