<h2> John 17 </h2>

<h4>  Jesus Prays for Himself </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Jesus spoke these words, lifted up His eyes to heaven, and said:<a style="color: #770000;">  "Father, the hour has come. Glorify Your Son, that Your Son also may glorify You,</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a><a style="color: #770000;">as You have given Him authority over all flesh, that He should give eternal life to as many as You have given Him.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a><a style="color: #770000;">And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a><a style="color: #770000;">I have glorified You on the earth. I have finished the work which You have given Me to do.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a><a style="color: #770000;">And now, O Father, glorify Me together with Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.</a></p>
<h4> Jesus Prays for His Disciples  </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a><a style="color: #770000;"> "I have manifested Your name to the men whom You have given Me out of the world. They were Yours, You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word. </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a><a style="color: #770000;">Now they have known that all things which You have given Me are from You.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a><a style="color: #770000;">For I have given to them the words which You have given Me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came forth from You; and they have believed that You sent Me.</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a><a style="color: #770000;"> "I pray for them. I do not pray for the world but for those whom You have given Me, for they are Yours.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a><a style="color: #770000;">And all Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine, and I am glorified in them.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a><a style="color: #770000;">Now I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to You. Holy Father, keep through Your name those whom You have given Me, that they may be one as We are.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a><a style="color: #770000;">While I was with them in the world, I kept them in Your name. Those whom You gave Me I have kept; and none of them is lost except the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a><a style="color: #770000;">But now I come to You, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have My joy fulfilled in themselves. </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a><a style="color: #770000;">I have given them Your word; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a><a style="color: #770000;">I do not pray that You should take them out of the world, but that You should keep them from the evil one. </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a><a style="color: #770000;">They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a><a style="color: #770000;">Sanctify them by Your truth. Your word is truth. </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a><a style="color: #770000;">As You sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world. </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a><a style="color: #770000;">And for their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also may be sanctified by the truth.</a></p>
<h4>  Jesus Prays for All Believers </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a><a style="color: #770000;"> "I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who will believe in Me through their word;</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a><a style="color: #770000;">that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they also may be one in Us, that the world may believe that You sent Me. </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a><a style="color: #770000;">And the glory which You gave Me I have given them, that they may be one just as We are one:</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a><a style="color: #770000;">I in them, and You in Me; that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that You have sent Me, and have loved them as You have loved Me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a><a style="color: #770000;"> "Father, I desire that they also whom You gave Me may be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory which You have given Me; for You loved Me before the foundation of the world.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/71-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a><a style="color: #770000;">O righteous Father! The world has not known You, but I have known You; and these have known that You sent Me.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/71-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a><a style="color: #770000;">And I have declared to them Your name, and will declare it, that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them. "</a></p>
