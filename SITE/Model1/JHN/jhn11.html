<h2> John 11 </h2>


<h4>The Death of Lazarus</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>It was that Mary who anointed the Lord with fragrant oil and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Therefore the sisters sent to Him, saying, �Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.�</a>





<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>When Jesus heard that, He said,<a style="color:#770000;"> �This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it.�</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</p>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>So, when He heard that he was sick, He stayed two more days in the place where He was. 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Then after this He said to the disciples,<a style="color:#770000;"> �Let us go to Judea again.�</a></p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>The disciples said to Him, �Rabbi, lately the Jews sought to stone You, and are You going there again?�</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Jesus answered, <a style="color:#770000;">�Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a><a style="color:#770000;">But if one walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.�</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>These things He said, and after that He said to them,<a style="color:#770000;"> �Our friend Lazarus sleeps, but I go that I may wake him up.�</a></p>




<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Then His disciples said, �Lord, if he sleeps he will get well.� </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>However, Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that He was speaking about taking rest in sleep.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Then Jesus said to them plainly,<a style="color:#770000;"> �Lazarus is dead. </a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a><a style="color:#770000;">And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, that you may believe. Nevertheless let us go to him.�</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Then Thomas, who is called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, �Let us also go, that we may die with Him.�</p>

<h4>I Am the Resurrection and the Life</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away.</a>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>And many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met Him, but Mary was sitting in the house. </a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Now Martha said to Jesus, �Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>But even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You.�</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Jesus said to her, <a style="color:#770000;">�Your brother will rise again.�</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>Martha said to Him, �I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.�</a>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Jesus said to her, <a style="color:#770000;">�I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a><a style="color:#770000;">And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?�</a></p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>She said to Him, �Yes, Lord, I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who is to come into the world.�</a>

<h4>Jesus and Death, the Last Enemy</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>And when she had said these things, she went her way and secretly called Mary her sister, saying, �The Teacher has come and is calling for you.�
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly and came to Him.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>Now Jesus had not yet come into the town, but was in the place where Martha met Him.</a>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and comforting her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, �She is going to the tomb to weep there.�</a>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>Then, when Mary came where Jesus was, and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying to Him, �Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.�</a>




<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>And He said,<a style="color:#770000;"> �Where have you laid him?�</a>They said to Him, �Lord, come and see.�</a>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a>Jesus wept.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-36.htm" target="_blank">36</a>Then the Jews said, �See how He loved him!�</a>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-37.htm" target="_blank">37</a>And some of them said, �Could not this Man, who opened the eyes of the blind, also have kept this man from dying?�


<h4>Lazarus Raised from the Dead</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-38.htm" target="_blank">38</a>Then Jesus, again groaning in Himself, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it. </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-39.htm" target="_blank">39</a>Jesus said, �Take away the stone.�Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to Him, �Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days.�</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-40.htm" target="_blank">40</a>Jesus said to her,<a style="color:#770000;"> �Did I not say to you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?�</a> </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-41.htm" target="_blank">41</a>Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said,<a style="color:#770000;"> �Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.</a></p>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-42.htm" target="_blank">42</a><a style="color:#770000;">And I know that You always hear Me, but because of the people who are standing by I said this, that they may believe that You sent Me.�</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-43.htm" target="_blank">43</a>Now when He had said these things, He cried with a loud voice,<a style="color:#770000;"> �Lazarus, come forth!�</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-44.htm" target="_blank">44</a>And he who had died came out bound hand and foot with graveclothes, and his face was wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them,<a style="color:#770000;"> �Loose him, and let him go.�</a></p>

<h4>The Plot to Kill Jesus</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-45.htm" target="_blank">45</a>Then many of the Jews who had come to Mary, and had seen the things Jesus did, believed in Him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-46.htm" target="_blank">46</a>But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them the things Jesus did. </p>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-47.htm" target="_blank">47</a>Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council and said, �What shall we do? For this Man works many signs.
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-48.htm" target="_blank">48</a>If we let Him alone like this, everyone will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation.�</p>




<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-49.htm" target="_blank">49</a>And one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, �You know nothing at all, 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-50.htm" target="_blank">50</a>nor do you consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation should perish.� 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-51.htm" target="_blank">51</a>Now this he did not say on his own authority; but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-52.htm" target="_blank">52</a>and not for that nation only, but also that He would gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-53.htm" target="_blank">53</a>Then, from that day on, they plotted to put Him to death.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-54.htm" target="_blank">54</a>Therefore Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there into the country near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there remained with His disciples.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-55.htm" target="_blank">55</a>And the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went from the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-56.htm" target="_blank">56</a>Then they sought Jesus, and spoke among themselves as they stood in the temple, �What do you think�that He will not come to the feast?� 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-57.htm" target="_blank">57</a>Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command, that if anyone knew where He was, he should report it, that they might seize Him.</p>
