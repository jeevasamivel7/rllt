<h2>Philemon 1 </h2>


<h4>Greeting</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,To Philemon our beloved friend and fellow laborer,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>to the beloved Apphia, Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<h4>Philemon's Love and Faith</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>that the sharing of your faith may become effective by the acknowledgment of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the  hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother.</p>
<h4>The Plea for Onesimus</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Therefore, though I might be very bold in Christ to command you what is fitting, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>yet for love's sake I rather appeal to you-being such a one as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ'
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten while in my chains, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>who once was unprofitable to you, but now is profitable to you and to me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>I am sending him back. You therefore receive him, that is, my own heart, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>whom I wished to keep with me, that on your behalf he might minister to me in my chains for the gospel. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>But without your consent I wanted to do nothing, that your good deed might not be by compulsion, as it were, but voluntary.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>For perhaps he departed for a while for this purpose, that you might receive him forever, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>no longer as a slave but more than a slave'a beloved brother, especially to me but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</p>
<h4>Philemo's Obedience Encouraged</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>If then you count me as a partner, receive him as you would me. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>But if he has wronged you or owes anything, put that on my account. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>I, Paul, am writing with my own hand. I will repay-not to mention to you that you owe me even your own self besides. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in the Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>But, meanwhile, also prepare a guest room for me, for I trust that through your prayers I shall be granted to you.</p>
<h4>Farewell</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow laborers.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
