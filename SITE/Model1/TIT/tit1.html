<h2>Titus 1 </h2>


<h4>Greeting</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Paul, a bondservant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect and the acknowledgment of the truth which accords with godliness, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>in hope of eternal life which God, who cannot lie, promised before time began, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>but has in due time manifested His word through preaching, which was committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>To Titus, a true son in our common faith:Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.</p>
<h4>Qualified Elders</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>For this reason I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are lacking, and appoint elders in every city as I commanded you— 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>if a man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of [b]dissipation or insubordination. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>For a bishop must be blameless, as a steward of God, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>but hospitable, a lover of what is good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able, by sound doctrine, both to exhort and convict those who contradict.</p>
<h4>The Elders’ Task</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>For there are many insubordinate, both idle talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole households, teaching things which they ought not, for the sake of dishonest gain. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.”
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn from the truth.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>To the pure all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but even their mind and conscience are defiled. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>They profess to know God, but in works they deny Him, being abominable, disobedient, and disqualified for every good work.</p>
