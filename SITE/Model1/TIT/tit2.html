<h2>Titus 2 </h2>


<h4>Qualities of a Sound Church</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>But as for you, speak the things which are proper for sound doctrine: 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>that the older men be sober, reverent, temperate, sound in faith, in love, in patience; 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>the older women likewise, that they be reverent in behavior, not slanderers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things"
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>that they admonish the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>to be discreet, chaste, homemakers, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be blasphemed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Likewise, exhort the young men to be sober-minded, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>in all things showing yourself to be a pattern of good works; in doctrine showing integrity, reverence, incorruptibility,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>sound speech that cannot be condemned, that one who is an opponent may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say of you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Exhort bondservants to be obedient to their own masters, to be well pleasing in all things, not answering back, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>not pilfering, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.</p>
<h4>Trained by Saving Grace</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for Himself His own special people, zealous for good works.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Speak these things, exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you.</p>
