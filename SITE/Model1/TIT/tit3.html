<h2>Titus 3 </h2>


<h4>Graces of the Heirs of Grace</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to obey, to be ready for every good work,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>to speak evil of no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing all humility to all men. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>For we ourselves were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>But when the kindness and the love of God our Savior toward man appeared,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>whom He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>that having been justified by His grace we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>This is a faithful saying, and these things I want you to affirm constantly, that those who have believed in God should be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men.</p>
<h4>Avoid Dissension</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>But avoid foolish disputes, genealogies, contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and useless.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Reject a divisive man after the first and second admonition, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>knowing that such a person is warped and sinning, being self-condemned.</p>
<h4>Final Messages</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey with haste, that they may lack nothing.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>And let our people also learn to maintain good works, to meet urgent needs, that they may not be unfruitful.</p>
<h4>Farewell </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith.

Grace be with you all. Amen.</p>
