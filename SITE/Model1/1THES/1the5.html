<h2>1 Thessalonians 5</h2>


<h4>The Day of the Lord</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need that I should write to you.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>For you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>For when they say, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction comes upon them, as labor pains upon a pregnant woman. And they shall not escape.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>But you, brethren, are not in darkness, so that this Day should overtake you as a thief. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>You are all sons of light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of darkness. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Therefore let us not sleep, as others do, but let us watch and be sober. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk are drunk at night.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>But let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet the hope of salvation.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with Him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Therefore comfort each other and edify one another, just as you also are doing.</p>
<h4>Various Exhortations</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>And we urge you, brethren, to recognize those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord and admonish you, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>and to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. Be at peace among yourselves.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Now we exhort you, brethren, warn those who are unruly, comfort the fainthearted, uphold the weak, be patient with all.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>See that no one renders evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue what is good both for yourselves and for all.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Rejoice always, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>pray without ceasing, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Do not quench the Spirit. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Do not despise prophecies.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Test all things; hold fast what is good.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Abstain from every form of evil.</p>
<h4>Blessing and Admonition</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>He who calls you is faithful, who also will do it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Brethren, pray for us.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</p>
