<h2> Romans 15 </h2>


<h4>Bearing Others’ Burdens</h4>




<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>We then who are strong ought to bear with the scruples of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, leading to edification.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>For even Christ did not please Himself; but as it is written, “The reproaches of those who reproached You fell on Me.” 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that we through the patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Now may the God of patience and comfort grant you to be like-minded toward one another, according to Christ Jesus,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>that you may with one mind and one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>


<h4>Glorify God Together</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Therefore receive one another, just as Christ also received us, to the glory of God.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Now I say that Jesus Christ has become a servant to the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers, 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>and that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy, as it is written:“For this reason I will confess to You among the Gentiles,And sing to Your name.”</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>And again he says:“Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His people!”</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>And again:“Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles!Laud Him, all you peoples!”</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>And again, Isaiah says:“There shall be a root of Jesse;And He who shall rise to reign over the Gentiles,In Him the Gentiles shall hope.”</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<h4>From Jerusalem to Illyricum</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Now I myself am confident concerning you, my brethren, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Nevertheless, brethren, I have written more boldly to you on some points, as reminding you, because of the grace given to me by God,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>that I might be a minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering [g]of the Gentiles might be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Therefore I have reason to glory in Christ Jesus in the things which pertain to God. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not accomplished through me, in word and deed, to make the Gentiles obedient— 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>in mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem and round about to Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>And so I have made it my aim to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build on another man’s foundation,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>but as it is written:“To whom He was not announced, they shall see;And those who have not heard shall understand.”</p>



<h4>Plan to Visit Rome</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>For this reason I also have been much hindered from coming to you.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>But now no longer having a place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>whenever I journey to Spain, I shall come to you. For I hope to see you on my journey, and to be helped on my way there by you, if first I may enjoy your company for a while.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>But now I am going to Jerusalem to [i]minister to the saints. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>For it pleased those from Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints who are in Jerusalem.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>It pleased them indeed, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in material things.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>Therefore, when I have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit, I shall go by way of you to Spain.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>But I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>Now I beg you, brethren, through the Lord Jesus Christ, and through the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in prayers to God for me,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>that I may be delivered from those in Judea who [k]do not believe, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints, </p>
 <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>that I may come to you with joy by the will of God, and may be refreshed together with you.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</p>
