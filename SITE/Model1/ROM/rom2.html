<h2> Romans 2 </h2>


<h4>God’s Righteous Judgment</h4>




<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Therefore you are inexcusable, O man, whoever you are who judge, for in whatever you judge another you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same things.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>And do you think this, O man, you who judge those practicing such things, and doing the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Or do you despise the riches of His goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance? </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>But in accordance with your hardness and your impenitent heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>who “will render to each one according to his deeds”:
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>eternal life to those who by patient continuance in doing good seek for glory, honor, and immortality;
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>but to those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness—indignation and wrath, </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>tribulation and anguish, on every soul of man who does evil, of the Jew first and also of the Greek; 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>but glory, honor, and peace to everyone who works what is good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>For there is no partiality with God.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without law, and as many as have sinned in the law will be judged by the law 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>(for not the hearers of the law are just in the sight of God, but the doers of the law will be justified;
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>for when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do the things in the law, these, although not having the law, are a law to themselves,</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and between themselves their thoughts accusing or else excusing them)</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>in the day when God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.</p>


<h4>The Jews Guilty as the Gentiles</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Indeed you are called a Jew, and rest on the law, and make your boast in God,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>and know His will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>and are confident that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,

<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having the form of knowledge and truth in the law.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>You, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that a man should not steal, do you steal? 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>You who say, “Do not commit adultery,” do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>You who make your boast in the law, do you dishonor God through breaking the law?
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>For “the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,” as it is written.</p>




<h4>Circumcision of No Avail</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>For circumcision is indeed profitable if you keep the law; but if you are a breaker of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>Therefore, if an uncircumcised man keeps the righteous requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be counted as circumcision? </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>And will not the physically uncircumcised, if he fulfills the law, judge you who, even with your written code and circumcision, are a transgressor of the law?
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh; 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the Spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not from men but from God.</p>
