<h2> Romans 14 </h2>


<h4>The Law of Liberty</h4>





<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Receive one who is weak in the faith, but not to disputes over doubtful things.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>For one believes he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats only vegetables. </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats; for God has received him.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Who are you to judge another’s servant? To his own master he stands or falls. Indeed, he will be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>One person esteems one day above another; another esteems every day alike. Let each be fully convinced in his own mind. </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; [a]and he who does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe it. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he who does not eat, to the Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>For none of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>For if we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>For to this end Christ died and rose and lived again, that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living.
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you show contempt for your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>For it is written:“As I live, says the Lord,Every knee shall bow to Me,And every tongue shall confess to God.”</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>So then each of us shall give account of himself to God.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Therefore let us not judge one another anymore, but rather resolve this, not to put a stumbling block or a cause to fall in our brother’s way.</p>

<h4>The Law of Love</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>I know and am convinced by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself; but to him who considers anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Yet if your brother is grieved because of your food, you are no longer walking in love. Do not destroy with your food the one for whom Christ died. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Therefore do not let your good be spoken of as evil;
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>For he who serves Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Therefore let us pursue the things which make for peace and the things by which one may edify another.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All things indeed are pure, but it is evil for the man who eats with offense.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>It is good neither to eat meat nor drink wine nor do anything by which your brother stumbles or is offended or is made weak.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Do you have faith? Have it to yourself before God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not eat from faith; for whatever is not from faith is sin.</p>
