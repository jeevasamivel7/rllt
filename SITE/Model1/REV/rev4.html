<h2>Revelation4</h2>


<h4>The Throne Room of Heaven</h4>


<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven. And the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying,"Come up here, and I will show you things which must take place after this."</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne set in heaven, and One sat on the throne.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>And He who sat there was like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance; and there was a rainbow around the throne, in appearance like an emerald. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white robes; and they had crowns of gold on their heads.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>And from the throne proceeded lightnings, thunderings, and voices. Seven lamps of fire were burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</p>




<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Before the throne there was a sea of glass, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature like a calf, the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>The four living creatures, each having six wings, were full of eyes around and within. And they do not rest day or night, saying:"Holy,holy, holy,Lord God Almighty,Who was and is and is to come!"</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever,</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying:</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>"You are worthy, O Lord,To receive glory and honor and power;For You created all things,And by Your will they exist and were created."</p>
