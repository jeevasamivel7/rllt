<h2> Psalms 97 </h2>

<h4>  A Song of Praise to the Sovereign Lord </h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>The Lord reigns;Let the earth rejoice;Let the multitude of isles be glad!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Clouds and darkness surround Him;Righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>A fire goes before Him,And burns up His enemies round about.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>His lightnings light the world;The earth sees and trembles.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>The mountains melt like wax at the presence of the Lord,At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>The heavens declare His righteousness,And all the peoples see His glory.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Let all be put to shame who serve carved images,Who boast of idols.Worship Him, all you gods.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Zion hears and is glad,And the daughters of Judah rejoice Because of Your judgments, O Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>For You, Lord, are most high above all the earth;You are exalted far above all gods.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>You who love the Lord, hate evil!He preserves the souls of His saints;He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Light is sown for the righteous,And gladness for the upright in heart.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Rejoice in the Lord, you righteous,And give thanks at the remembrance of His holy name.</p>
