<h2>Psalms 51  </h2>

<h4> A Prayer of Repentance  </h4>
<h5>  To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David when Nathan the prophet went to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Have mercy upon me, O God,According to Your lovingkindness;According to the multitude of Your tender mercies,Blot out my transgressions.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity,And cleanse me from my sin.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>For I acknowledge my transgressions,And my sin is always before me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Against You, You only, have I sinned,And done this evil in Your sight—That You may be found just when You speak,And blameless when You judge.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,And in sin my mother conceived me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts,And in the hidden part You will make me to know wisdom.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean;Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Make me hear joy and gladness,That the bones You have broken may rejoice.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Hide Your face from my sins,And blot out all my iniquities.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Create in me a clean heart, O God,And renew a steadfast spirit within me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Do not cast me away from Your presence,And do not take Your Holy Spirit from me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Restore to me the joy of Your salvation,And uphold me by Your generous Spirit.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Then I will teach transgressors Your ways,And sinners shall be converted to You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God,The God of my salvation,And my tongue shall sing aloud of Your righteousness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>O Lord, open my lips,And my mouth shall show forth Your praise.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>For You do not desire sacrifice, or else I would give it;You do not delight in burnt offering.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit,A broken and a contrite heart—These, O God, You will not despise.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Do good in Your good pleasure to Zion;Build the walls of Jerusalem.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Then You shall be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness,With burnt offering and whole burnt offering;Then they shall offer bulls on Your altar.</p>
