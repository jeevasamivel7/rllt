<h2>Psalms 105  </h2>

<h4>  The Eternal Faithfulness of the Lord </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Oh, give thanks to the Lord!Call upon His name;Make known His deeds among the peoples!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Sing to Him, sing psalms to Him;Talk of all His wondrous works!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Glory in His holy name;Let the hearts of those rejoice who seek the Lord!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Seek the Lord and His strength;Seek His face evermore!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Remember His marvelous works which He has done,His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>O seed of Abraham His servant,You children of Jacob, His chosen ones!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>He is the Lord our God;His judgments are in all the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>He remembers His covenant forever,The word which He commanded, for a thousand generations,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>The covenant which He made with Abraham,And His oath to Isaac,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>And confirmed it to Jacob for a statute,To Israel as an everlasting covenant,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan As the allotment of your inheritance,"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>When they were few in number,Indeed very few, and strangers in it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>When they went from one nation to another,From one kingdom to another people,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>He permitted no one to do them wrong;Yes, He rebuked kings for their sakes,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Saying, "Do not touch My anointed ones,And do My prophets no harm."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Moreover He called for a famine in the land;He destroyed all the provision of bread.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>He sent a man before them-Joseph-who was sold as a slave.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>They hurt his feet with fetters,He was laid in irons.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Until the time that his word came to pass,The word of the Lord tested him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>The king sent and released him,The ruler of the people let him go free.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>He made him lord of his house,And ruler of all his possessions,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>To bind his princes at his pleasure,And teach his elders wisdom.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Israel also came into Egypt,And Jacob dwelt in the land of Ham.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>He increased His people greatly,And made them stronger than their enemies.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>He turned their heart to hate His people,To deal craftily with His servants.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>He sent Moses His servant,And Aaron whom He had chosen.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>They performed His signs among them,And wonders in the land of Ham.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>He sent darkness, and made it dark;And they did not rebel against His word.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-28.htm" target="_blank">29</a>He turned their waters into blood,And killed their fish.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>Their land abounded with frogs,Even in the chambers of their kings.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>He spoke, and there came swarms of flies,And lice in all their territory.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>He gave them hail for rain,And flaming fire in their land.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>He struck their vines also, and their fig trees,And splintered the trees of their territory.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>He spoke, and locusts came,Young locusts without number,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a>And ate up all the vegetation in their land,And devoured the fruit of their ground.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-36.htm" target="_blank">36</a>He also destroyed all the firstborn in their land,The first of all their strength.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-37.htm" target="_blank">37</a>He also brought them out with silver and gold,And there was none feeble among His tribes.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-38.htm" target="_blank">38</a>Egypt was glad when they departed,For the fear of them had fallen upon them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-39.htm" target="_blank">39</a>He spread a cloud for a covering,And fire to give light in the night.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-40.htm" target="_blank">40</a>The people asked, and He brought quail,And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-41.htm" target="_blank">41</a>He opened the rock, and water gushed out;It ran in the dry places like a river.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-42.htm" target="_blank">42</a>For He remembered His holy promise,And Abraham His servant.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-43.htm" target="_blank">43</a>He brought out His people with joy,His chosen ones with gladness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-44.htm" target="_blank">44</a>He gave them the lands of the Gentiles,And they inherited the labor of the nations,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-45.htm" target="_blank">45</a>That they might observe His statutes And keep His laws.Praise the Lord!</p>
