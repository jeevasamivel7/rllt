<h2> Psalms 92 </h2>

<h4> Praise to the Lord for His Love and Faithfulness  </h4>
<h5>  A Psalm. A Song for the Sabbath day. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>It is good to give thanks to the Lord,And to sing praises to Your name, O Most High;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>To declare Your lovingkindness in the morning,And Your faithfulness every night,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>On an instrument of ten strings,On the lute,And on the harp,With harmonious sound.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>For You, Lord, have made me glad through Your work;I will triumph in the works of Your hands.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>O Lord, how great are Your works!Your thoughts are very deep.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>A senseless man does not know,Nor does a fool understand this.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>When the wicked spring up like grass,And when all the workers of iniquity flourish,It is that they may be destroyed forever.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>But You, Lord, are on high forevermore.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>For behold, Your enemies, O Lord,For behold, Your enemies shall perish;All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>But my horn You have exalted like a wild ox;I have been anointed with fresh oil.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>My eye also has seen my desire on my enemies;My ears hear my desire on the wicked Who rise up against me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>The righteous shall flourish like a palm tree,He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Those who are planted in the house of the Lord Shall flourish in the courts of our God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>They shall still bear fruit in old age;They shall be fresh and flourishing,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>To declare that the Lord is upright;He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.</p>
