<h2> Psalms 91 </h2>

<h4> Safety of Abiding in the Presence of God  </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress;My God, in Him I will trust.”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler And from the perilous pestilence.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>He shall cover you with His feathers,And under His wings you shall take refuge;His truth shall be your shield and buckler.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>You shall not be afraid of the terror by night,Nor of the arrow that flies by day,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness,Nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>A thousand may fall at your side,And ten thousand at your right hand;But it shall not come near you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Only with your eyes shall you look,And see the reward of the wicked.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Because you have made the Lord, who is my refuge,Even the Most High, your dwelling place,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>No evil shall befall you,Nor shall any plague come near your dwelling;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>For He shall give His angels charge over you,To keep you in all your ways.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>In their hands they shall bear you up,Lest you dash your foot against a stone.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>You shall tread upon the lion and the cobra,The young lion and the serpent you shall trample underfoot.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>“Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore I will deliver him;I will set him on high, because he has known My name.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him;I will be with him in trouble;I will deliver him and honor him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>With long life I will satisfy him,
And show him My salvation.”</p>
