<h2> Psalms 71 </h2>

<h4> God the Rock of Salvation  </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>In You, O Lord, I put my trust;Let me never be put to shame.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Deliver me in Your righteousness, and cause me to escape;Incline Your ear to me, and save me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Be my strong refuge,To which I may resort continually;You have given the commandment to save me,For You are my rock and my fortress.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked,Out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>For You are my hope, O Lord God;You are my trust from my youth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>By You I have been upheld from birth;You are He who took me out of my mother’s womb.My praise shall be continually of You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>I have become as a wonder to many,But You are my strong refuge.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Let my mouth be filled with Your praise And with Your glory all the day.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Do not cast me off in the time of old age;Do not forsake me when my strength fails.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>For my enemies speak against me;And those who lie in wait for my life take counsel together,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Saying, “God has forsaken him;Pursue and take him, for there is none to deliver him.”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>O God, do not be far from me;O my God, make haste to help me!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Let them be confounded and consumed Who are adversaries of my life; Let them be covered with reproach and dishonor Who seek my hurt.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>But I will hope continually,And will praise You yet more and more.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>5My mouth shall tell of Your righteousness And Your salvation all the day,For I do not know their limits.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>I will go in the strength of the Lord God;I will make mention of Your righteousness, of Yours only.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>O God, You have taught me from my youth;And to this day I declare Your wondrous works.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Now also when I am old and grayheaded,O God, do not forsake me,Until I declare Your strength to this generation,Your power to everyone who is to come.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Also Your righteousness, O God, is very high,You who have done great things;O God, who is like You?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>You, who have shown me great and severe troubles,Shall revive me again,And bring me up again from the depths of the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>You shall increase my greatness,And comfort me on every side.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Also with the lute I will praise You— And Your faithfulness, O my God!To You I will sing with the harp,O Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>My tongue also shall talk of Your righteousness all the day long;For they are confounded,For they are brought to shame Who seek my hurt.</p>
