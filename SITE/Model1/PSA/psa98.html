<h4>  A Song of Praise to the Lord for His Salvation and Judgment A Psalm. </h4>
  
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Oh, sing to the Lord a new song!For He has done marvelous things;His right hand and His holy arm have gained Him the victory.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>The Lord has made known His salvation;His righteousness He has revealed in the sight of the nations.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>He has remembered His mercy and His faithfulness to the house of Israel;All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Shout joyfully to the Lord, all the earth;Break forth in song, rejoice, and sing praises.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Sing to the Lord with the harp,With the harp and the sound of a psalm,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>With trumpets and the sound of a horn;Shout joyfully before the Lord, the King.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Let the sea roar, and all its fullness,The world and those who dwell in it;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Let the rivers clap their hands;Let the hills be joyful together</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>before the Lord,For He is coming to judge the earth.With righteousness He shall judge the world,And the peoples with equity.</p>
