<h2> Psalms 19 </h2>

<h4> The Perfect Revelation of the Lord  </h4>
<h5>  To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-1.htm">1</a>The heavens declare the glory of God;And the firmament shows His handiwork.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-2.htm">2</a>Day unto day utters speech,And night unto night reveals knowledge.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-3.htm">3</a>There is no speech nor languageWhere their voice is not heard.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-4.htm">4</a>Their line has gone out through all the earth,And their words to the end of the world.In them He has set a tabernacle for the sun,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-5.htm">5</a>Which is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,And rejoices like a strong man to run its race.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-6.htm">6</a>Its rising is from one end of heaven,And its circuit to the other end;And there is nothing hidden from its heat.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-7.htm">7</a>The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul;The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-8.htm">8</a>The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart;The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-9.htm">9</a>The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever;The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-10.htm">10</a>More to be desired are they than gold,Yea, than much fine gold;Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-11.htm">11</a>Moreover by them Your servant is warned,And in keeping them there is great reward.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-12.htm">12</a>Who can understand his errors?Cleanse me from secret faults.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-13.htm">13</a>Keep back Your servant also from presumptuous sins;Let them not have dominion over me.Then I shall be blameless,And I shall be innocent of great transgression.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-14.htm">14</a>Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heartBe acceptable in Your sight,O Lord, my strength and my Redeemer.</p>
