<h2> Psalms 137 </h2>

<h4> Longing for Zion in a Foreign Land  </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>By the rivers of Babylon,There we sat down, yea, we wept When we remembered Zion.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>We hung our harps Upon the willows in the midst of it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>For there those who carried us away captive asked of us a song,And those who plundered us requested mirth,Saying, "Sing us one of the songs of Zion!"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>How shall we sing the Lord's song In a foreign land?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>If I forget you, O Jerusalem,Let my right hand forget its skill!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>If I do not remember you,Let my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth-If I do not exalt Jerusalem Above my chief joy.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Remember, O Lord, against the sons of Edom The day of Jerusalem,Who said, "Raze it, raze it,To its very foundation!"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>O daughter of Babylon, who are to be destroyed,Happy the one who repays you as you have served us!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Happy the one who takes and dashes Your little ones against the rock!</p>
