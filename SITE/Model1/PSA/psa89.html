<h2>Psalms 89  </h2>

<h4> Remembering the Covenant with David, and Sorrow for Lost Blessings  </h4>
<h5> A Contemplation of Ethan the Ezrahite.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever;With my mouth will I make known Your faithfulness to all generations.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>For I have said, “Mercy shall be built up forever;Your faithfulness You shall establish in the very heavens.”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>“I have made a covenant with My chosen,I have sworn to My servant David:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>‘Your seed I will establish forever,And build up your throne to all generations.’ ” Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>And the heavens will praise Your wonders, O Lord;Your faithfulness also in the assembly of the saints.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>For who in the heavens can be compared to the Lord?Who among the sons of the mighty can be likened to the Lord?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints,And to be held in reverence by all those around Him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>O Lord God of hosts,Who is mighty like You, O Lord?Your faithfulness also surrounds You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>You rule the raging of the sea;When its waves rise, You still them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>You have broken Rahab in pieces, as one who is slain;You have scattered Your enemies with Your mighty arm.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>The heavens are Yours, the earth also is Yours;The world and all its fullness, You have founded them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>The north and the south, You have created them;Tabor and Hermon rejoice in Your name.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>You have a mighty arm;Strong is Your hand, and high is Your right hand.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne;Mercy and truth go before Your face.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Blessed are the people who know the joyful sound!They walk, O Lord, in the light of Your countenance.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>In Your name they rejoice all day long,And in Your righteousness they are exalted.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>For You are the glory of their strength,And in Your favor our horn is exalted.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>For our shield belongs to the Lord,And our king to the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Then You spoke in a vision to Your holy one,And said: “I have given help to one who is mighty;I have exalted one chosen from the people.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>I have found My servant David;With My holy oil I have anointed him,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>With whom My hand shall be established;Also My arm shall strengthen him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>The enemy shall not outwit him,Nor the son of wickedness afflict him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>I will beat down his foes before his face,And plague those who hate him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>“But My faithfulness and My mercy shall be with him,And in My name his horn shall be exalted.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Also I will set his hand over the sea,And his right hand over the rivers.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>He shall cry to Me, ‘You are my Father,My God, and the rock of my salvation.’</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>Also I will make him My firstborn,The highest of the kings of the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>My mercy I will keep for him forever,And My covenant shall stand firm with him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-28.htm" target="_blank">29</a>His seed also I will make to endure forever,And his throne as the days of heaven.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>“If his sons forsake My law And do not walk in My judgments,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>If they break My statutes And do not keep My commandments,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>Then I will punish their transgression with the rod,And their iniquity with stripes.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>Nevertheless My lovingkindness I will not utterly take from him,Nor allow My faithfulness to fail.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>My covenant I will not break,Nor alter the word that has gone out of My lips.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a>Once I have sworn by My holiness;I will not lie to David:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-36.htm" target="_blank">36</a>His seed shall endure forever,And his throne as the sun before Me;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-37.htm" target="_blank">37</a>It shall be established forever like the moon,Even like the faithful witness in the sky.” Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-38.htm" target="_blank">38</a>But You have cast off and abhorred,You have been furious with Your anointed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-39.htm" target="_blank">39</a>You have renounced the covenant of Your servant;You have profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-40.htm" target="_blank">40</a>You have broken down all his hedges;You have brought his strongholds to ruin.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-41.htm" target="_blank">41</a>All who pass by the way plunder him;He is a reproach to his neighbors.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-42.htm" target="_blank">42</a>You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries;You have made all his enemies rejoice.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-43.htm" target="_blank">43</a>You have also turned back the edge of his sword,And have not sustained him in the battle.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-44.htm" target="_blank">44</a>You have made his glory cease,And cast his throne down to the ground.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-45.htm" target="_blank">45</a>The days of his youth You have shortened;You have covered him with shame. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-46.htm" target="_blank">46</a>How long, Lord?Will You hide Yourself forever?Will Your wrath burn like fire?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-47.htm" target="_blank">47</a>Remember how short my time is;For what futility have You created all the children of men?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-48.htm" target="_blank">48</a>What man can live and not see death?Can he deliver his life from the power of the grave? Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-48.htm" target="_blank">49</a>Lord, where are Your former lovingkindnesses,Which You swore to David in Your truth?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-50.htm" target="_blank">50</a>Remember, Lord, the reproach of Your servants—How I bear in my bosom the reproach of all the many peoples,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-51.htm" target="_blank">51</a>With which Your enemies have reproached, O Lord,With which they have reproached the footsteps of Your anointed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-52.htm" target="_blank">52</a>Blessed be the Lord forevermore!Amen and Amen.</p>
