<h2>Psalms 77  </h2>

<h4>  The Consoling Memory of God’s Redemptive Works </h4>
<h5>  To the Chief Musician. To Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>I cried out to God with my voice—To God with my voice;And He gave ear to me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord;My hand was stretched out in the night without ceasing;My soul refused to be comforted.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>I remembered God, and was troubled;I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>You hold my eyelids open;I am so troubled that I cannot speak.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>I have considered the days of old,The years of ancient times.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>I call to remembrance my song in the night;I meditate within my heart,And my spirit makes diligent search.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Will the Lord cast off forever?And will He be favorable no more?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Has His mercy ceased forever?Has His promise failed forevermore?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Has God forgotten to be gracious?Has He in anger shut up His tender mercies? Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>And I said, “This is my anguish;But I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High.”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>I will remember the works of the Lord;Surely I will remember Your wonders of old.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>I will also meditate on all Your work,And talk of Your deeds.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Your way, O God, is in the sanctuary;Who is so great a God as our God?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>You are the God who does wonders;You have declared Your strength among the peoples.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>You have with Your arm redeemed Your people,The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>The waters saw You, O God;The waters saw You, they were afraid;The depths also trembled.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>The clouds poured out water;The skies sent out a sound;Your arrows also flashed about.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>The voice of Your thunder was in the whirlwind;The lightnings lit up the world;The earth trembled and shook.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Your way was in the sea,Your path in the great waters,And Your footsteps were not known.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>You led Your people like a flock By the hand of Moses and Aaron.</p>
