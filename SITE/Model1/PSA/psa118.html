<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>This was the Lord's doing;It is marvelous in our eyes.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>This is the day the Lord has made;We will rejoice and be glad in it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Save now, I pray, O Lord;O Lord, I pray, send now prosperity.</p>
