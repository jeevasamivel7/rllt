<h2>2Timothy 2 </h2>


<h4>Be Strong in Grace</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>And the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>No one engaged in warfare entangles himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who enlisted him as a soldier. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>And also if anyone competes in athletics, he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>The hardworking farmer must be first to partake of the crops.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was raised from the dead according to my gospel, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>for which I suffer trouble as an evildoer, even to the point of chains; but the word of God is not chained.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>This is a faithful saying:For if we died with Him,We shall also live with Him.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>If we endure,We shall also reign with Him.If we deny Him,He also will deny us.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>f we are faithless,He remains faithful;He cannot deny Himself.</p>
 <h4>roved and Disapproved Workers</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Remind them of these things, charging them before the Lord not to strive about words to no profit, to the ruin of the hearers.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>But shun profane and idle babblings, for they will increase to more ungodliness.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>And their message will spread like cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are of this sort,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>who have strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past; and they overthrow the faith of some.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Nevertheless the solid foundation of God stands, having this seal: “The Lord knows those who are His,” and, “Let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay, some for honor and some for dishonor. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Therefore if anyone cleanses himself from the latter, he will be a vessel for honor, [h]sanctified and useful for the Master, prepared for every good work. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Flee also youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>But avoid foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they generate strife. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him to do his will.</p>
