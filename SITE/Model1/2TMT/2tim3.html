<h2>2 Timothy 3 </h2>


<h4>Perilous Times and Perilous Men</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come: </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good, </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>having a form of godliness but denying its power. And from such people turn away!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>For of this sort are those who creep into households and make captives of gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Now as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, disapproved concerning the faith; </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>but they will progress no further, for their folly will be manifest to all, as theirs also was.</p>
<h4>The Man of God and the Word of God</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>But you have carefully followed my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, perseverance, </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>persecutions, afflictions, which happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra—what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.</p>
