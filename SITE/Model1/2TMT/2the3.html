<h2>1Timothy 1</h2>


<h4>Greeting</h4>

1Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the commandment of God our Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope,

2To Timothy, a true son in the faith:

Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.

No Other Doctrine
3As I urged you when I went into Macedonia—remain in Ephesus that you may charge some that they teach no other doctrine,
 4nor give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which cause disputes rather than godly edification which is in faith. 
5Now the purpose of the commandment is love from a pure heart, from a good conscience, and from sincere faith, 6from which some, having strayed, have turned aside to idle talk, 
7desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say nor the things which they affirm.

8But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, 
9knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, 
10for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine, 
11according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God which was committed to my trust.

Glory to God for His Grace
12And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has enabled me, because He counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry, 
13although I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an [d]insolent man; but I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. 
14And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant, with faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. 
15This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief. 
16However, for this reason I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show all longsuffering, as a pattern to those who are going to believe on Him for everlasting life. 
17Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to [e]God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.

Fight the Good Fight
18This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may wage the good warfare, 
19having faith and a good conscience, which some having rejected, concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck, 
20of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme.
