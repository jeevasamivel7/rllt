<h2>  Matthew 15 </h2>

<h4>Defilement Comes from Within</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-1.htm">1</a>Then the scribes and Pharisees who were from Jerusalem came to Jesus, saying,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-2.htm">2</a>"Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-3.htm">3</a>He answered and said to them,<a style="color: #770000;"> "Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition? </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-4.htm">4</a><a style="color: #770000;">For God commanded, saying, "Honor your father and your mother"; and, "He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death."</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-5.htm">5</a><a style="color: #770000;">But you say, "Whoever says to his father or mother, "Whatever profit you might have received from me is a gift to God""</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-6.htm">6</a><a style="color: #770000;">then he need not honor his father or mother."" Thus you have made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-7.htm">7</a><a style="color: #770000;">Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying:</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-8.htm">8</a><a style="color: #770000;">"These people draw near to Me with their mouth,And honor Me with their lips,But their heart is far from Me</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-9.htm">9</a><a style="color: #770000;">And in vain they worship Me,Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men." "</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-10.htm">10</a>When He had called the multitude to Himself, He said to them, <a style="color: #770000;">"Hear and understand: </a>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-11.htm">11</a><a style="color: #770000;">Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man; but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man."</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-12.htm">12</a>Then His disciples came and said to Him, "Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?"</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-13.htm">13</a>But He answered and said, <a style="color: #770000;">"Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.</a> </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-14.htm">14</a><a style="color: #770000;">Let them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind leads the blind, both will fall into a ditch."</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-15.htm">15</a>Then Peter answered and said to Him, "Explain this parable to us."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-16.htm">16</a><a style="color: #770000;">So Jesus said, <a style="color: #770000;">"Are you also still without understanding?</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-17.htm">17</a><a style="color: #770000;">Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated?</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-18.htm">18</a><a style="color: #770000;">But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-19.htm">19</a><a style="color: #770000;">For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies.</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-20.htm">20</a><a style="color: #770000;">These are the things which defile a man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man."</a></p>
<h4>A Gentile Shows Her Faith</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-21.htm">21</a>Then Jesus went out from there and departed to the region of Tyre and Sidon. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-22.htm">22</a>And behold, a woman of Canaan came from that region and cried out to Him, saying, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-23.htm">23</a>But He answered her not a word.And His disciples came and urged Him, saying, "Send her away, for she cries out after us."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-24.htm">24</a>But He answered and said,<a style="color: #770000;"> "I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-25.htm">25</a>Then she came and worshiped Him, saying, "Lord, help me!"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-26.htm">26</a>But He answered and said, <a style="color: #770000;">"It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs."</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-27.htm">27</a>And she said, "Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters' table."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-28.htm">28</a>Then Jesus answered and said to her,<a style="color: #770000;"> "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire."</a> And her daughter was healed from that very hour.</p>
<h4>Jesus Heals Great Multitudes</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-29.htm">29</a>Jesus departed from there, skirted the Sea of Galilee, and went up on the mountain and sat down there.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-30.htm">30</a>Then great multitudes came to Him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others; and they laid them down at Jesus' feet, and He healed them. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-31.htm">31</a>So the multitude marveled when they saw the mute speaking, the maimed made whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.</p>
<h4>Feeding the Four Thousand</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-32.htm">32</a>Now Jesus called His disciples to Himself and said,<a style="color: #770000;">"I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now continued with Me three days and have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way."</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-33.htm">33</a>Then His disciples said to Him, "Where could we get enough bread in the wilderness to fill such a great multitude?"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-34.htm">34</a>Jesus said to them,<a style="color: #770000;"> "How many loaves do you have?"</a>And they said, "Seven, and a few little fish."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-35.htm">35</a>So He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-36.htm">36</a>And He took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks, broke them and gave them to His disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitude. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-37.htm">37</a>So they all ate and were filled, and they took up seven large baskets full of the fragments that were left. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-38.htm">38</a>Now those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-39.htm">39</a>And He sent away the multitude, got into the boat, and came to the region of Magdala.</p>
