<h2>  Matthew 22</h2>

<h4> The Parable of the Wedding Feast</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-1.htm">1</a>And Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables and said: </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-2.htm">2</a><a style="color: #770000;">"The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who arranged a marriage for his son, </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-3.htm">3</a><a style="color: #770000;">and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding; and they were not willing to come.</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-4.htm">4</a><a style="color: #770000;">Again, he sent out other servants, saying, "Tell those who are invited, "See, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fatted cattle are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding." "</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-5.htm">5</a><a style="color: #770000;">But they made light of it and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his business.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-6.htm">6</a><a style="color: #770000;">And the rest seized his servants, treated them spitefully, and killed them.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-7.htm">7</a><a style="color: #770000;">But when the king heard about it, he was furious. And he sent out his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-8.htm">8</a><a style="color: #770000;">Then he said to his servants, "The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy. </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-9.htm">9</a><a style="color: #770000;">Therefore go into the highways, and as many as you find, invite to the wedding."</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-10.htm">10</a><a style="color: #770000;">So those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all whom they found, both bad and good. And the wedding hall was filled with guests.</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-11.htm">11</a><a style="color: #770000;">"But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw a man there who did not have on a wedding garment.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-12.htm">12</a><a style="color: #770000;">So he said to him, "Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?" And he was speechless.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-13.htm">13</a><a style="color: #770000;">Then the king said to the servants, "Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-14.htm">14</a>"For many are called, but few are chosen."</p>
<h4>The Pharisees: Is It Lawful to Pay Taxes to Caesar?</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-15.htm">15</a>Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they might entangle Him in His talk.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-16.htm">16</a>And they sent to Him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that You are true, and teach the way of God in truth; nor do You care about anyone, for You do not regard the person of men.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-17.htm">17</a>Tell us, therefore, what do You think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-18.htm">18</a>But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said,<a style="color: #770000;"> "Why do you test Me, you hypocrites?</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-19.htm">19</a><a style="color: #770000;">Show Me the tax money.</a>"So they brought Him a denarius.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-20.htm">20</a>And He said to them,<a style="color: #770000;"> "Whose image and inscription is this?"</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-21.htm">21</a>They said to Him, "Caesar's."And He said to them, <a style="color: #770000;">"Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-22.htm">22</a>When they had heard these words, they marveled, and left Him and went their way.</p>
<h4>The Sadducees: What About the Resurrection?</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-23.htm">23</a>The same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Him and asked Him,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-24.htm">24</a>saying: "Teacher, Moses said that if a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up offspring for his brother.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-25.htm">25</a>Now there were with us seven brothers. The first died after he had married, and having no offspring, left his wife to his brother.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-26.htm">26</a>Likewise the second also, and the third, even to the seventh.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-27.htm">27</a>Last of all the woman died also.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-28.htm">28</a>Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had her."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-29.htm">29</a>Jesus answered and said to them, <a style="color: #770000;">"You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-30.htm">30</a><a style="color: #770000;">For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels of God in heaven.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-31.htm">31</a><a style="color: #770000;">But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, saying, </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-32.htm">32</a><a style="color: #770000;">"I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living." </p>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-33.htm">33</a>And when the multitudes heard this, they were astonished at His teaching.</p>
<h4>The Scribes: Which Is the First Commandment of All?</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-34.htm">34</a>But when the Pharisees heard that He had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-35.htm">35</a>Then one of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him, and saying,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-36.htm">36</a>"Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-37.htm">37</a>Jesus said to him,<a style="color: #770000;">"'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.'</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-38.htm">38</a><a style="color: #770000;">This is the first and great commandment. </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-39.htm">39</a><a style="color: #770000;">And the second is like it: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-40.htm">40</a><a style="color: #770000;">On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets."</a></p>
<h4>Jesus: How Can David Call His Descendant Lord?</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-41.htm">41</a>While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-42.htm">42</a>saying, <a style="color: #770000;">"What do you think about the Christ? Whose Son is He?"</a>They said to Him, "The Son of David."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-43.htm">43</a>He said to them, <a style="color: #770000;">"How then does David in the Spirit call Him "Lord," saying:</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-44.htm">44</a><a style="color: #770000;">"The Lord said to my Lord,"Sit at My right hand,Till I make Your enemies Your footstool"'?</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-45.htm">45</a><a style="color: #770000;">If David then calls Him "Lord," how is He his Son?"</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-46.htm">46</a>And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor from that day on did anyone dare question Him anymore.</p>
