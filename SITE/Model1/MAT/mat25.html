<h2>  Matthew 25 </h2>

<h4>   The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-1.htm">1</a><a style="color: #770000;">"Then the kingdom of heaven shall be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-2.htm">2</a><a style="color: #770000;">Now five of them were wise, and five were foolish.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-3.htm">3</a><a style="color: #770000;">Those who were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them,</a. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-4.htm">4</a><a style="color: #770000;">but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-5.htm">5</a><a style="color: #770000;">But while the bridegroom was delayed, they all slumbered and slept.</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-6.htm">6</a><a style="color: #770000;">"And at midnight a cry was heard: "Behold, the bridegroom is coming; go out to meet him!'"</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-7.htm">7</a><a style="color: #770000;">Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps. </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-8.htm">8</a><a style="color: #770000;">And the foolish said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-9.htm">9</a><a style="color: #770000;">But the wise answered, saying, "No, lest there should not be enough for us and you; but go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves."</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-10.htm">10</a><a style="color: #770000;">And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding; and the door was shut.</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-11.htm">11</a><a style="color: #770000;">"Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, "Lord, Lord, open to us!"</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-12.htm">12</a><a style="color: #770000;">But he answered and said, "Assuredly, I say to you, I do not know you."</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-13.htm">13</a><a style="color: #770000;">"Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.</a></p>
<h4> The Parable of the Talents  </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-14.htm">14</a><a style="color: #770000;">"For the kingdom of heaven is like a man traveling to a far country, who called his own servants and delivered his goods to them.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-15.htm">15</a><a style="color: #770000;">And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability; and immediately he went on a journey.</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-16.htm">16</a><a style="color: #770000;">Then he who had received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents.</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-17.htm">17</a><a style="color: #770000;">And likewise he who had received two gained two more also.</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-18.htm">18</a><a style="color: #770000;">But he who had received one went and dug in the ground, and hid his lord's money.</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-19.htm">19</a><a style="color: #770000;">After a long time the lord of those servants came and settled accounts with them.</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-20.htm">20</a><a style="color: #770000;">"So he who had received five talents came and brought five other talents, saying, "Lord, you delivered to me five talents; look, I have gained five more talents besides them."</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-21.htm">21</a><a style="color: #770000;">His lord said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant; you were faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord."</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-22.htm">22</a><a style="color: #770000;">He also who had received two talents came and said, "Lord, you delivered to me two talents; look, I have gained two more talents besides them."</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-23.htm">23</a><a style="color: #770000;">His lord said to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord."</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-24.htm">24</a><a style="color: #770000;">"Then he who had received the one talent came and said, "Lord, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not scattered seed.</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-25.htm">25</a><a style="color: #770000;">And I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the ground. Look, there you have what is yours."</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-26.htm">26</a><a style="color: #770000;">"But his lord answered and said to him, "You wicked and lazy servant, you knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not scattered seed. </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-27.htm">27</a><a style="color: #770000;">So you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest. </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-28.htm">28</a><a style="color: #770000;">So take the talent from him, and give it to him who has ten talents.</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-29.htm">29</a><a style="color: #770000;">"For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-30.htm">30</a><a style="color: #770000;">And cast the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."</a></p>
<h4>  The Son of Man Will Judge the Nations </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm">31</a><a style="color: #770000;">"When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then He will sit on the throne of His glory.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-32.htm">32</a><a style="color: #770000;">All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats.</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-33.htm">33</a><a style="color: #770000;">And He will set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left.</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-34.htm">34</a><a style="color: #770000;">Then the King will say to those on His right hand, "Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-35.htm">35</a><a style="color: #770000;">for I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in;</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-36.htm">36</a><a style="color: #770000;">I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me."</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-37.htm">37</a><a style="color: #770000;">"Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, "Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink?</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-38.htm">38</a><a style="color: #770000;">When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You?</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-39.htm">39</a><a style="color: #770000;">Or when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?"</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-40.htm">40</a><a style="color: #770000;">And the King will answer and say to them, "Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me."</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-41.htm">41</a><a style="color: #770000;">"Then He will also say to those on the left hand, "Depart from Me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels: </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-42.htm">42</a><a style="color: #770000;">for I was hungry and you gave Me no food; I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink; </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-43.htm">43</a><a style="color: #770000;">I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, naked and you did not clothe Me, sick and in prison and you did not visit Me."</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-44.htm">44</a><a style="color: #770000;">"Then they also will answer Him, saying, "Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You?"</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-45.htm">45</a><a style="color: #770000;">Then He will answer them, saying, "Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me."</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-46.htm">46</a><a style="color: #770000;">And these will go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."</a></p>
