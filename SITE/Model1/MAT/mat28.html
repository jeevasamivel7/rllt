<h2> Matthew 28 </h2>

<h4>He Is Risen</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-1.htm">1</a>Now after the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-2.htm">2</a>And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat on it.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-3.htm">3</a>His countenance was like lightning, and his clothing as white as snow. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-4.htm">4</a>And the guards shook for fear of him, and became like dead men.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-5.htm">5</a>But the angel answered and said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-6.htm">6</a>He is not here; for He is risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-7.htm">7</a>And go quickly and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead, and indeed He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him. Behold, I have told you."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-8.htm">8</a>So they went out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring His disciples word.</p>
<h4>The Women Worship the Risen Lord</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-9.htm">9</a>And as they went to tell His disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying,<a style="color: #770000;">"Rejoice!"</a> So they came and held Him by the feet and worshiped Him. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-10.htm">10</a>Then Jesus said to them,<a style="color: #770000;"> "Do not be afraid. Go and tell My brethren to go to Galilee, and there they will see Me."</a></p>
<h4> The Soldiers Are Bribed</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-11.htm">11</a>Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-12.htm">12</a>When they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-13.htm">13</a>saying, 'Tell them, "His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we slept."
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-14.htm">14</a>And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will appease him and make you secure." 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-15.htm">15</a>So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</p>
<h4>  The Great Commission </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-16.htm">16</a>Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had appointed for them. </P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-17.htm">17</a>When they saw Him, they worshiped Him; but some doubted.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm">18</a>And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying,<a style="color: #770000;"> "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm">19</a><a style="color: #770000;">Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-20.htm">20</a><a style="color: #770000;">teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."</a> Amen.</p>
