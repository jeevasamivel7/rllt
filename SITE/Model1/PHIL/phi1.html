<h2>Philippians 1 </h2>


<h4>Greeting</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Paul and Timothy, bondservants of Jesus Christ,To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<h4>Thankfulness and Prayer</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>always in every prayer of mine making request for you all with joy,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ; 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>just as it is right for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as both in my chains and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers with me of grace. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>For God is my witness, how greatly I long for you all with the affection of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>that you may approve the things that are excellent, that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</p>
<h4>Christ Is Preached</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>But I want you to know, brethren, that the things which happened to me have actually turned out for the furtherance of the gospel, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>so that it has become evident to the whole palace guard, and to all the rest, that my chains are in Christ; 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>and most of the brethren in the Lord, having become confident by my chains, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife, and some also from goodwill:
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>The former preach Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my chains; 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel. </p>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; and in this I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.</p>
<h4>To Live Is Christ</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>For I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>according to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>But if I live on in the flesh, this will mean fruit from my labor; yet what I shall choose I cannot tell. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>For I am hard-pressed between the two, having a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>Nevertheless to remain in the flesh is more needful for you. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>And being confident of this, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy of faith,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>that your rejoicing for me may be more abundant in Jesus Christ by my coming to you again.</p>
<h4>Striving and Suffering for Christ</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>Only let your conduct be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>and not in any way terrified by your adversaries, which is to them a proof of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that from God.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>For to you it has been granted on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>having the same conflict which you saw in me and now hear is in me.</p>
