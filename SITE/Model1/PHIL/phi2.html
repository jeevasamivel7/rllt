<h2>Philippians 2</h2>


<h4>Unity Through Humility</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Therefore if there is any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and mercy,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>fulfill my joy by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others.</p>
 <h4>The Humbled and Exalted Christ</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>
  <h4>Light Bearers</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Do all things without complaining and disputing,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>holding fast the word of life, so that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain or labored in vain.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Yes, and if I am being poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>For the same reason you also be glad and rejoice with me.</p>
  <h4>Timothy Commended</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be encouraged when I know your state. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>For I have no one like-minded, who will sincerely care for your state. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>For all seek their own, not the things which are of Christ Jesus.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a><But you know his proven character, that as a son with his father he served with me in the gospel. 
   <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it goes with me.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>But I trust in the Lord that I myself shall also come shortly.</p>
 <h4>Epaphroditus Praised</h4> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Yet I considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, but your messenger and the one who ministered to my need; 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>since he was longing for you all, and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>For indeed he was sick almost unto death; but God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>Therefore I sent him the more eagerly, that when you see him again you may rejoice, and I may be less sorrowful.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and hold such men in esteem; 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>because for the work of Christ he came close to death, not regarding his life, to supply what was lacking in your service toward me.</p>
