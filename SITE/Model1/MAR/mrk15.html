<h2> Mark 15 </h2>

<h4>  Jesus Faces Pilate </h4> 

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Immediately, in the morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council; and they bound Jesus, led Him away, and delivered Him to Pilate. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Then Pilate asked Him, "Are You the King of the Jews?"He answered and said to him, <a style="color: #770000;">"It is as you say."</a></p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>And the chief priests accused Him of many things, but He answered nothing.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Then Pilate asked Him again, saying, "Do You answer nothing? See how many things they testify against You!" 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>But Jesus still answered nothing, so that Pilate marveled.</p>
<h4> Taking the Place of Barabbas  </h4> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Now at the feast he was accustomed to releasing one prisoner to them, whomever they requested. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>And there was one named Barabbas, who was chained with his fellow rebels; they had committed murder in the rebellion.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Then the multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do just as he had always done for them. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>But Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?" 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>For he knew that the chief priests had handed Him over because of envy.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd, so that he should rather release Barabbas to them. </p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Pilate answered and said to them again, "What then do you want me to do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?"
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>So they cried out again, "Crucify Him!"</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Then Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has He done?"But they cried out all the more, "Crucify Him!"</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>So Pilate, wanting to gratify the crowd, released Barabbas to them; and he delivered Jesus, after he had scourged Him, to be crucified.</p>
<h4> The Soldiers Mock Jesus  </h4> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Then the soldiers led Him away into the hall called Praetorium, and they called together the whole garrison. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>And they clothed Him with purple; and they twisted a crown of thorns, put it on His head, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>and began to salute Him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Then they struck Him on the head with a reed and spat on Him; and bowing the knee, they worshiped Him.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>And when they had mocked Him, they took the purple off Him, put His own clothes on Him, and led Him out to crucify Him.</p>
<h4> The King on a Cross  </h4> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Then they compelled a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian, the father of Alexander and Rufus, as he was coming out of the country and passing by, to bear His cross. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>And they brought Him to the place Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Then they gave Him wine mingled with myrrh to drink, but He did not take it. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>And when they crucified Him, they divided His garments, casting lots for them to determine what every man should take.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Now it was the third hour, and they crucified Him. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>And the inscription of His accusation was written above:THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>With Him they also crucified two robbers, one on His right and the other on His left. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>So the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "And He was numbered with the transgressors."</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>And those who passed by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads and saying, "Aha! You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>save Yourself, and come down from the cross!"</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>Likewise the chief priests also, mocking among themselves with the scribes, said, "He saved others; Himself He cannot save. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe."Even those who were crucified with Him reviled Him.</p>
<h4>  Jesus Dies on the Cross </h4> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>Now when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, <a style="color: #770000;">"Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?"</a> which is translated, <a style="color: #770000;">"My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</a></p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a>Some of those who stood by, when they heard that, said, "Look, He is calling for Elijah!" 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-36.htm" target="_blank">36</a>Then someone ran and filled a sponge full of sour wine, put it on a reed, and offered it to Him to drink, saying, "Let Him alone; let us see if Elijah will come to take Him down."</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-37.htm" target="_blank">37</a>And Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and breathed His last.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-38.htm" target="_blank">38</a>Then the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-39.htm" target="_blank">39</a>So when the centurion, who stood opposite Him, saw that He cried out like this and breathed His last, he said, "Truly this Man was the Son of God!"</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-40.htm" target="_blank">40</a>There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joses, and Salome, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-41.htm" target="_blank">41</a>who also followed Him and ministered to Him when He was in Galilee, and many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem.</p>
<h4>  Jesus Buried in Joseph"s Tomb </h4> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-42.htm" target="_blank">42</a>Now when evening had come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-43.htm" target="_blank">43</a>Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent council member, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, coming and taking courage, went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-44.htm" target="_blank">44</a>Pilate marveled that He was already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him if He had been dead for some time. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-45.htm" target="_blank">45</a>So when he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-46.htm" target="_blank">46</a>Then he bought fine linen, took Him down, and wrapped Him in the linen. And he laid Him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock, and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-47.htm" target="_blank">47</a>And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses observed where He was laid.</p>
