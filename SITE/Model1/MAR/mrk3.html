<h2> Mark 3 </h2>

<h4> Healing on the Sabbath  </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>And He entered the synagogue again, and a man was there who had a withered hand.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>So they watched Him closely, whether He would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse Him. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>And He said to the man who had the withered hand, <a style="color: #770000;">"Step forward."</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Then He said to them,<a style="color: #770000;"> "Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?" </a>But they kept silent. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>And when He had looked around at them with anger, being grieved by the hardness of their hearts, He said to the man, <a style="color: #770000;">"Stretch out your hand." </a>And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored as whole as the other. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Then the Pharisees went out and immediately plotted with the Herodians against Him, how they might destroy Him.</p> 
<h4>  A Great Multitude Follows Jesus </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>But Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea. And a great multitude from Galilee followed Him, and from Judea 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>and Jerusalem and Idumea and beyond the Jordan; and those from Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they heard how many things He was doing, came to Him.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>So He told His disciples that a small boat should be kept ready for Him because of the multitude, lest they should crush Him.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>For He healed many, so that as many as had afflictions pressed about Him to touch Him.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw Him, fell down before Him and cried out, saying, "You are the Son of God." 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>But He sternly warned them that they should not make Him known.</p>
<h4>  The Twelve Apostles </h4> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>And He went up on the mountain and called to Him those He Himself wanted. And they came to Him. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Then He appointed twelve, that they might be with Him and that He might send them out to preach,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>and to have power to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons: 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Simon, to whom He gave the name Peter; 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James, to whom He gave the name Boanerges, that is, "Sons of Thunder"; 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Cananite; 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him. And they went into a house.</p>
<h4>  A House Divided Cannot Stand </h4> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Then the multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>But when His own people heard about this, they went out to lay hold of Him, for they said, "He is out of His mind."</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, "He has Beelzebub," and, "By the ruler of the demons He casts out demons."</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>So He called them to Himself and said to them in parables:<a style="color: #770000;"> "How can Satan cast out Satan? </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a><a style="color: #770000;">If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a><a style="color: #770000;">And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a><a style="color: #770000;">And if Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a><a style="color: #770000;">No one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. And then he will plunder his house.</a></p> 
<h4> The Unpardonable Sin  </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a><a style="color: #770000;">"Assuredly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they may utter;</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a><a style="color: #770000;">but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation'" </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>because they said, "He has an unclean spirit."</p> 
<h4> Jesus' Mother and Brothers Send for Him  </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>Then His brothers and His mother came, and standing outside they sent to Him, calling Him. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>And a multitude was sitting around Him; and they said to Him, "Look, Your mother and Your brothers are outside seeking You."</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>But He answered them, saying,<a style="color: #770000;"> "Who is My mother, or My brothers?" </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>And He looked around in a circle at those who sat about Him, and said, <a style="color: #770000;">"Here are My mother and My brothers!</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a><a style="color: #770000;">For whoever does the will of God is My brother and My sister and mother."</a></p>
