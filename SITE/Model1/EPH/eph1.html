<h4>Redemption in Christ</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He made us accepted in the Beloved.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>which He made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>that in the dispensation of the fullness of the times He might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earthâ€”in Him.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>In Him also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>that we who first trusted in Christ should be to the praise of His glory.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory.</p>
<h4>Prayer for Spiritual Wisdom</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Therefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers: 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>and what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>And He put all things under His feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the church,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.</p>
