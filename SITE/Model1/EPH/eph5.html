<h2> Ephesians 5</h2>


<h4>Walk in Love</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Therefore be imitators of God as dear children. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us and given Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling aroma.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as is fitting for saints; 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>For this you know, that no fornicator, unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Therefore do not be partakers with them.</p>
<h4>Walk in Light</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>(for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, righteousness, and truth), 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>finding out what is acceptable to the Lord.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather expose them.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>For it is shameful even to speak of those things which are done by them in secret. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>But all things that are exposed are made manifest by the light, for whatever makes manifest is light. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Therefore He says:“Awake, you who sleep,Arise from the dead,And Christ will give you light.”</p>
<h4>Walk in Wisdom</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Therefore do not be unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord is. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation; but be filled with the Spirit, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>giving thanks always for all things to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>submitting to one another in the fear of God.</p>
<h4>Marriage—Christ and the Church</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>For the husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is head of the church; and He is the Savior of the body.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>Therefore, just as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>that He might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>that He might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>So husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he who loves his wife loves himself. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as the Lord does the church.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>For we are members of His body, [h]of His flesh and of His bones. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>“For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>Nevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.</p>
