<h2> Ephesians 3</h2>


<h4>The Mystery Revealed</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you Gentiles— </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>if indeed you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which was given to me for you, </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>how that by revelation He made known to me the mystery (as I have briefly written already,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>by which, when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ),</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to His holy apostles and prophets:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, of the same body, and partakers of His promise in Christ through the gospel,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>of which I became a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the effective working of His power.</p>
  <h4>Purpose of the Mystery</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>To me, who am less than the least of all the saints, this grace was given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>and to make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the ages has been hidden in God who created all things [c]through Jesus Christ;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>to the intent that now the manifold wisdom of God might be made known by the church to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places, </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>according to the eternal purpose which He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through faith in Him. </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Therefore I ask that you do not lose heart at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.</p>
  <h4>Appreciation of the Mystery</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>hat Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and depth and height— </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>to Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.</p>
