<h2> Job 2 </h2>


<h4>Satan Attacks Job's Health</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>And the Lord said to Satan, �From where do you come?�Satan answered the Lord and said, �From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.�</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Then the Lord said to Satan, �Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil? And still he holds fast to his integrity, although you incited Me against him, to destroy him without cause.�</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>So Satan answered the Lord and said, �Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>But stretch out Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will surely curse You to Your face!�</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>And the Lord said to Satan, �Behold, he is in your hand, but spare his life.�</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord, and struck Job with painful boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>And he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape himself while he sat in the midst of the ashes.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Then his wife said to him, �Do you still hold fast to your integrity? Curse God and die!�</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>But he said to her, �You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Shall we indeed accept good from God, and shall we not accept adversity?� In all this Job did not sin with his lips.,</p>


<h4>Job�s Three Friends</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Now when Job�s three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him, each one came from his own place�Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment together to come and mourn with him, and to comfort him.
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>And when they raised their eyes from afar, and did not recognize him, they lifted their voices and wept; and each one tore his robe and sprinkled dust on his head toward heaven.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.</p>
