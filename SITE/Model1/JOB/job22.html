<h2> Job 22 </h2>


<h4>Eliphaz Accuses Job of Wickedness
</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>"Can a man be profitable to God,Though he who is wise may be profitable to himself?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that you are righteous?Or is it gain to Him that you make your ways blameless?</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>"Is it because of your fear of Him that He corrects you,And enters into judgment with you?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Is not your wickedness great,And your iniquity without end?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>For you have taken pledges from your brother for no reason,And stripped the naked of their clothing.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>You have not given the weary water to drink,And you have withheld bread from the hungry.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>But the [a]mighty man possessed the land,And the honorable man dwelt in it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>You have sent widows away empty,And the [b]strength of the fatherless was crushed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Therefore snares are all around you,And sudden fear troubles you,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Or darkness so that you cannot see;And an abundance of water covers you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>"Is not God in the height of heaven?And see the highest stars, how lofty they are!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>And you say,'What does God know?Can He judge through the deep darkness?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Thick clouds cover Him, so that He cannot see,And He walks above the circle of heaven.'</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Will you keep to the old wayWhich wicked men have trod,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Who were cut down before their time,Whose foundations were swept away by a flood?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>They said to God,'Depart from us!What can the Almighty do to them?'</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Yet He filled their houses with good things;But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>"The righteous see it and are glad,And the innocent laugh at them:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>'Surely our adversaries are cut down,And the fire consumes their remnant.'</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>"Now acquaint yourself with Him, and be at peace;Thereby good will come to you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Receive, please, instruction from His mouth,And lay up His words in your heart.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up;You will remove iniquity far from your tents.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>Then you will lay your gold in the dust,And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Yes, the Almighty will be your goldAnd your precious silver;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>For then you will have your delight in the Almighty,And lift up your face to God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>You will make your prayer to Him,He will hear you,And you will pay your vows.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>You will also declare a thing,And it will be established for you;So light will shine on your ways.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>When they cast you down, and you say,'Exaltation will come!'Then He will save the humble person.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>He will even deliver one who is not innocent;Yes, he will be delivered by the purity of your hands."</p>
