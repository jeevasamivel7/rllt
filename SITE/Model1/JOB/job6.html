<h2> Job 6 </h2>


<h4>Job: My Complaint Is Just</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Then Job answered and said:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>�Oh, that my grief were fully weighed,And my calamity laid with it on the scales!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea�Therefore my words have been rash.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>For the arrows of the Almighty are within me;My spirit drinks in their poison;The terrors of God are arrayed against me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Does the wild donkey bray when it has grass,Or does the ox low over its fodder?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Can flavorless food be eaten without salt?Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>My soul refuses to touch them;They are as loathsome food to me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>�Oh, that I might have my request,That God would grant me the thing that I long for!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>That it would please God to crush me,That He would loose His hand and cut me off!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Then I would still have comfort;Though in anguish I would exult,He will not spare;For I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>�What strength do I have, that I should hope?And what is my end, that I should prolong my life?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Is my strength the strength of stones?Or is my flesh bronze?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Is my help not within me?And is success driven from me?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>�To him who is afflicted, kindness should be shown by his friend,Even though he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</p>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>My brothers have dealt deceitfully like a brook,Like the streams of the brooks that pass away,</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Which are dark because of the ice,And into which the snow vanishes.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>When it is warm, they cease to flow;When it is hot, they vanish from their place.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>The paths of their way turn aside,They go nowhere and perish.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>The caravans of Tema look,The travelers of Sheba hope for them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>They are disappointed because they were confident;They come there and are confused.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>For now you are nothing,You see terror and are afraid.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Did I ever say, �Bring something to me�?Or, �Offer a bribe for me from your wealth�?</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Or, �Deliver me from the enemy�s hand�?Or, �Redeem me from the hand of oppressors�?</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>�Teach me, and I will hold my tongue;Cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>How forceful are right words!But what does your arguing prove?</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>Do you intend to rebuke my words,And the speeches of a desperate one, which are as wind?</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>Yes, you overwhelm the fatherless,And you undermine your friend.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>Now therefore, be pleased to look at me;For I would never lie to your face.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>Yield now, let there be no injustice!Yes, concede, my righteousness still stands!</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>Is there injustice on my tongue?Cannot my taste discern the unsavory?</p>
