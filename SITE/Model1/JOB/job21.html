<h2> Job 21 </h2>


<h4>Job’s Discourse on the Wicked</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Then Job answered and said:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>“Listen carefully to my speech,And let this be your consolation.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Bear with me that I may speak,And after I have spoken, keep mocking.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>“As for me, is my complaint against man?And if it were, why should I not be impatient?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Look at me and be astonished;Put your hand over your mouth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Even when I remember I am terrified,And trembling takes hold of my flesh.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Why do the wicked live and become old,Yes, become mighty in power?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Their descendants are established with them in their sight,And their offspring before their eyes.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Their houses are safe from fear,Neither is the rod of God upon them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Their bull breeds without failure;Their cow calves without miscarriage.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>They send forth their little ones like a flock,And their children dance.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>They sing to the tambourine and harp,And rejoice to the sound of the flute.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>They spend their days in wealth,And in a moment go down to the grave.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Yet they say to God, ‘Depart from us,For we do not desire the knowledge of Your ways.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him?And what profit do we have if we pray to Him?’</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Indeed their prosperity is not in their hand;The counsel of the wicked is far from me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>“How often is the lamp of the wicked put out?How often does their destruction come upon them,The sorrows God distributes in His anger?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>They are like straw before the wind,And like chaff that a storm carries away.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>They say, ‘God lays up one’s iniquity for his children’;Let Him recompense him, that he may know it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Let his eyes see his destruction,And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>For what does he care about his household after him,When the number of his months is cut in half?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>“Can anyone teach God knowledge,Since He judges those on high?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>One dies in his full strength,Being wholly at ease and secure;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>His pails are full of milk,And the marrow of his bones is moist.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Another man dies in the bitterness of his soul,Never having eaten with pleasure.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>They lie down alike in the dust,And worms cover them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>“Look, I know your thoughts,And the schemes with which you would wrong me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>For you say,‘Where is the house of the prince?And where is [j]the tent,The dwelling place of the wicked?’</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>Have you not asked those who travel the road?And do you not know their signs?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>For the wicked are reserved for the day of doom;They shall be brought out on the day of wrath.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>Who condemns his way to his face?And who repays him for what he has done?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>Yet he shall be brought to the grave,And a vigil kept over the tomb.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him;Everyone shall follow him,As countless have gone before him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>How then can you comfort me with empty words,Since falsehood remains in your answers?”</p>
