<h2> Job 35 </h2>


<h4>Elihu Condemns Self-Righteousness</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Moreover Elihu answered and said:</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>�Do you think this is right?Do you say,�My righteousness is more than God�s�?</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>For you say,�What advantage will it be to You?What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?�</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>�I will answer you,And your companions with you.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Look to the heavens and see;And behold the clouds�They are higher than you.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>If you sin, what do you accomplish against Him?Or, if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to Him?</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>If you are righteous, what do you give Him?Or what does He receive from your hand?</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Your wickedness affects a man such as you,And your righteousness a son of man.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>�Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out;They cry out for help because of the arm of the mighty.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>But no one says, �Where is God my Maker,Who gives songs in the night,</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth,And makes us wiser than the birds of heaven?�</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>There they cry out, but He does not answer,Because of the pride of evil men.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Surely God will not listen to empty talk,Nor will the Almighty regard it.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Although you say you do not see Him,Yet justice is before Him, and you must wait for Him.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>And now, because He has not punished in His anger,Nor taken much notice of folly,</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Therefore Job opens his mouth in vain;He multiplies words without knowledge.�</p>
