<h2> Job 10 </h2>


<h4>Job: I Would Plead with God</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>"My soul loathes my life;I wil give free course to my complaint,I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>I will say to God,'Do not condemn me;Show me why You contend with me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Does it seem good to You that You should oppress,That You should despise the work of Your hands,And smile on the counsel of the wicked?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Do You have eyes of flesh?Or do You see as man sees?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Are Your days like the days of a mortal man?Are Your years like the days of a mighty man,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>That You should seek for my iniquityAnd search out my sin,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Although You know that I am not wicked,And there is no one who can deliver from Your hand?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>'Your hands have made me and fashioned me,An intricate unity;Yet You would destroy me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Remember, I pray, that You have made me like clay.And will You turn me into dust again?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Did You not pour me out like milk,And curdle me like cheese,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Clothe me with skin and flesh,And knit me together with bones and sinews?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>You have granted me life and favor,And Your care has preserved my spirit.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>'And these things You have hidden in Your heart;I know that this was with You:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>If I sin, then You mark me,And will not acquit me of my iniquity.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>If I am wicked, woe to me;Even if I am righteous, I cannot lift up my head.I am full of disgrace;See my misery!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>If my head is exalted,You hunt me like a fierce lion,And again You show Yourself awesome against me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>You renew Your witnesses against me,And increase Your indignation toward me;Changes and war are ever with me.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>'Why then have You brought me out of the womb?Oh, that I had perished and no eye had seen me!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>I would have been as though I had not been.I would have been carried from the womb to the grave.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Are not my days few?Cease! Leave me alone, that I may take a little comfort,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Before I go to the place from which I shall not return,To the land of darkness and the shadow of death,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>A land as dark as darkness itself,As the shadow of death, without any order,Where even the light is like darkness.'"</p>
