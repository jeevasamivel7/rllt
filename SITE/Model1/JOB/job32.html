<h2> Job 32 </h2>


<h4>Elihu Contradicts Job�s Friends</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>So these three men ceased answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Then the wrath of Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was aroused against Job; his wrath was aroused because he justified himself rather than God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Also against his three friends his wrath was aroused, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Now because they were years older than he, Elihu had waited to speak to Job.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a> When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was aroused.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>So Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, answered and said:�I am young in years, and you are very old;Therefore I was afraid,And dared not declare my opinion to you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>I said, �Age should speak,And multitude of years should teach wisdom.�</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>But there is a spirit in man,And the breath of the Almighty gives him understanding.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Great men are not always wise,Nor do the aged always understand justice.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>�Therefore I say, �Listen to me,I also will declare my opinion.�</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Indeed I waited for your words,I listened to your reasonings, while you searched out what to say.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>I paid close attention to you;And surely not one of you convinced Job,Or answered his words�</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Lest you say,�We have found wisdom�;God will vanquish him, not man.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Now he has not directed his words against me;So I will not answer him with your words.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>�They are dismayed and answer no more;Words escape them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>And I have waited, because they did not speak,Because they stood still and answered no more.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>I also will answer my part,I too will declare my opinion.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>For I am full of words;The spirit within me compels me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Indeed my belly is like wine that has no vent;It is ready to burst like new wineskins.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>I will speak, that I may find relief;I must open my lips and answer.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Let me not, I pray, show partiality to anyone;Nor let me flatter any man.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/32-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>For I do not know how to flatter,Else my Maker would soon take me away.</p>
