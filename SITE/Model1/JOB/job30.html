<h2> Job 30 </h2>


<h4>Job's Wealth Now Poverty</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>"But now they mock at me, men younger than I,Whose fathers I disdained to put with the dogs of my flock.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Indeed, what profit is the strength of their hands to me?Their vigor has perished.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>They are gaunt from want and famine,Fleeing late to the wilderness, desolate and waste,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Who pluck mallow by the bushes,And broom tree roots for their food.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>They were driven out from among men,They shouted at them as at a thief.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>They had to live in the clefts of the valleys,In caves of the earth and the rocks.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Among the bushes they brayed,Under the nettles they nestled.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>They were sons of fools,Yes, sons of vile men;They were scourged from the land.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>"And now I am their taunting song;Yes, I am their byword.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>They abhor me, they keep far from me;They do not hesitate to spit in my face.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Because He has loosed my bowstring and afflicted me,They have cast off restraint before me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>At my right hand the rabble arises;They push away my feet,And they raise against me their ways of destruction.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>They break up my path,They promote my calamity;They have no helper.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>They come as broad breakers;Under the ruinous storm they roll along.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Terrors are turned upon me;They pursue my honor as the wind,And my prosperity has passed like a cloud.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>"And now my soul is poured out because of my plight;The days of affliction take hold of me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>My bones are pierced in me at night,And my gnawing pains take no rest.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>By great force my garment is disfigured;It binds me about as the collar of my coat.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>He has cast me into the mire,And I have become like dust and ashes.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>"I cry out to You, but You do not answer me;I stand up, and You regard me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>But You have become cruel to me;With the strength of Your hand You oppose me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>You lift me up to the wind and cause me to ride on it;You spoil my success.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>For I know that You will bring me to death,And to the house appointed for all living.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>"Surely He would not stretch out His hand against a heap of ruins,If they cry out when He destroys it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Have I not wept for him who was in trouble?Has not my soul grieved for the poor?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>But when I looked for good, evil came to me;And when I waited for light, then came darkness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>My heart is in turmoil and cannot rest;Days of affliction confront me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>I go about mourning, but not in the sun;I stand up in the assembly and cry out for help.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>I am a brother of jackals,And a companion of ostriches.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>My skin grows black and falls from me;My bones burn with fever.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>My harp is turned to mourning,And my flute to the voice of those who weep.</p>
