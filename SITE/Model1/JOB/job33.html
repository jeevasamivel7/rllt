<h2> Job 33 </h2>


<h4>Elihu Contradicts Job</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>�But please, Job, hear my speech,And listen to all my words.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Now, I open my mouth;My tongue speaks in my mouth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>My words come from my upright heart;My lips utter pure knowledge.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>The Spirit of God has made me,And the breath of the Almighty gives me life.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>If you can answer me,Set your words in order before me;Take your stand.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Truly I am as your spokesman before God;I also have been formed out of clay.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Surely no fear of me will terrify you,Nor will my hand be heavy on you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>�Surely you have spoken in my hearing,And I have heard the sound of your words, saying,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>�I am pure, without transgression;I am innocent, and there is no iniquity in me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Yet He finds occasions against me,He counts me as His enemy;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>He puts my feet in the stocks,He watches all my paths.�</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>�Look, in this you are not righteous.I will answer you,For God is greater than man.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Why do you contend with Him?For He does not give an accounting of any of His words.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>For God may speak in one way, or in another,Yet man does not perceive it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>In a dream, in a vision of the night,When deep sleep falls upon men,While slumbering on their beds,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Then He opens the ears of men,And seals their instruction.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>In order to turn man from his deed,And conceal pride from man,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>He keeps back his soul from the Pit,And his life from perishing by the sword.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>�Man is also chastened with pain on his bed,And with strong pain in many of his bones,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>So that his life abhors bread,And his soul succulent food.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>His flesh wastes away from sight,And his bones stick out which once were not seen.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Yes, his soul draws near the Pit,And his life to the executioners.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>�If there is a messenger for him,A mediator, one among a thousand,To show man His uprightness,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>Then He is gracious to him, and says,�Deliver him from going down to the Pit;I have found a ransom�;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>His flesh shall be young like a child�s,He shall return to the days of his youth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>He shall pray to God, and He will delight in him,He shall see His face with joy,For He restores to man His righteousness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>Then he looks at men and says,�I have sinned, and perverted what was right,And it did not profit me.�</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>He will redeem his soul from going down to the Pit,And his life shall see the light.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>�Behold, God works all these things,Twice, in fact, three times with a man,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>To bring back his soul from the Pit,That he may be enlightened with the light of life.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>�Give ear, Job, listen to me;Hold your peace, and I will speak.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>If you have anything to say, answer me;Speak, for I desire to justify you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>If not, listen to me;Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom.�</p>
