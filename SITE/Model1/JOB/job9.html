<h2> Job 9 </h2>


<h4>Job: There Is No Mediator</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Then Job answered and said:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>"Truly I know it is so,But how can a man be righteous before God?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>If one wished to contend with Him,He could not answer Him one time out of a thousand.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>God is wise in heart and mighty in strength.Who has hardened himself against Him and prospered?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>He removes the mountains, and they do not knowWhen He overturns them in His anger;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>He shakes the earth out of its place,And its pillars tremble;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>He commands the sun, and it does not rise;He seals off the stars;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>He alone spreads out the heavens,And treads on the waves of the sea;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>He made the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades,And the chambers of the south;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>He does great things past finding out,Yes, wonders without number.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>If He goes by me, I do not see Him;If He moves past, I do not perceive Him;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>If He takes away, who can hinder Him?Who can say to Him, "What are You doing?"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>God will not withdraw His anger,The allies of the proud lie prostrate beneath Him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>"How then can I answer Him,And choose my words to reason with Him?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>For though I were righteous, I could not answer Him;I would beg mercy of my Judge.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>If I called and He answered me,I would not believe that He was listening to my voice.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>For He crushes me with a tempest,And multiplies my wounds without cause.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>He will not allow me to catch my breath,But fills me with bitterness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>If it is a matter of strength, indeed He is strong;And if of justice, who will appoint my day in court?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Though I were righteous, my own mouth would condemn me;Though I were blameless, it would prove me perverse.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>I am blameless, yet I do not know myself;I despise my life.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>It is all one thing;Therefore I say, "He destroys the blameless and the wicked."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>If the scourge slays suddenly,He laughs at the plight of the innocent.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>The earth is given into the hand of the wicked.He covers the faces of its judges.If it is not He, who else could it be?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>"Now my days are swifter than a runner;They flee away, they see no good.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>They pass by like swift ships,Like an eagle swooping on its prey.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>If I say,"I will forget my complaint,I will put off my sad face and wear a smile,"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>I am afraid of all my sufferings;I know that You will not hold me innocent.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>If I am condemned,Why then do I labor in vain?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>If I wash myself with snow water,And cleanse my hands with soap,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>Yet You will plunge me into the pit,And my own clothes will abhor me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>"For He is not a man, as I am,That I may answer Him,And that we should go to court together.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>Nor is there any mediator between us,Who may lay his hand on us both.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-33.htm" target="_blank">34</a>Let Him take His rod away from me,And do not let dread of Him terrify me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a>Then I would speak and not fear Him,But it is not so with me.</p>
