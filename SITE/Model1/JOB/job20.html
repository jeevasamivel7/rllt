<h2> Job 20 </h2>


<h4>Zophar's Sermon on the Wicked Man</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>"Therefore my anxious thoughts make me answer,Because of the turmoil within me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>I have heard the rebuke that reproaches me,And the spirit of my understanding causes me to answer.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>"Do you not know this of old,Since man was placed on earth,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>That the triumphing of the wicked is short,And the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Though his haughtiness mounts up to the heavens,And his head reaches to the clouds,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Yet he will perish forever like his own refuse;Those who have seen him will say,'Where is he?'</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>He will fly away like a dream, and not be found;Yes, he will be chased away like a vision of the night.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>The eye that saw him will see him no more,Nor will his place behold him anymore.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>His children will seek the favor of the poor,And his hands will restore his wealth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>His bones are full of his youthful vigor,But it will lie down with him in the dust.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>"Though evil is sweet in his mouth,And he hides it under his tongue,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Though he spares it and does not forsake it,But still keeps it in his mouth,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Yet his food in his stomach turns sour;It becomes cobra venom within him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>He swallows down richesAnd vomits them up again;God casts them out of his belly.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>He will suck the poison of cobras;The viper's tongue will slay him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>He will not see the streams,The rivers flowing with honey and cream.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>He will restore that for which he labored,And will not swallow it down;From the proceeds of businessHe will get no enjoyment.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor,He has violently seized a house which he did not build.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>"Because he knows no quietness in his heart,He will not save anything he desires.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Nothing is left for him to eat;Therefore his well-being will not last.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>In his self-sufficiency he will be in distress;Every hand of misery will come against him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>When he is about to fill his stomach,God will cast on him the fury of His wrath,And will rain it on him while he is eating.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>He will flee from the iron weapon;A bronze bow will pierce him through.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>It is drawn, and comes out of the body;Yes, the glittering point comes out of his gall.Terrors come upon him;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>Total darkness is reserved for his treasures.An unfanned fire will consume him;It shall go ill with him who is left in his tent.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>The heavens will reveal his iniquity,And the earth will rise up against him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>The increase of his house will depart,And his goods will flow away in the day of His wrath.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>This is the portion from God for a wicked man,The heritage appointed to him by God."</p>
