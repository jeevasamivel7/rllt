<h2> Job 4 </h2>


<h4>Eliphaz: Job Has Sinned</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>"If one attempts a word with you, will you become weary?But who can withhold himself from speaking?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Surely you have instructed many,And you have strengthened weak hands.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Your words have upheld him who was stumbling,And you have strengthened the feeble knees;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>But now it comes upon you, and you are weary;It touches you, and you are troubled.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Is not your reverence your confidence?And the integrity of your ways your hope?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>"Remember now, who ever perished being innocent?Or where were the upright ever cut off?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Even as I have seen,Those who plow iniquityAnd sow trouble reap the same.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>By the blast of God they perish,And by the breath of His anger they are consumed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>The roaring of the lion,The voice of the fierce lion,And the teeth of the young lions are broken.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>The old lion perishes for lack of prey,And the cubs of the lioness are scattered.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>"Now a word was secretly brought to me,And my ear received a whisper of it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>In disquieting thoughts from the visions of the night,When deep sleep falls on men,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Fear came upon me, and trembling,Which made all my bones shake.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Then a spirit passed before my face;The hair on my body stood up.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>It stood still,But I could not discern its appearance.A form was before my eyes;There was silence;Then I heard a voice saying:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>"Can a mortal be more righteous than God?Can a man be more pure than his Maker?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>If He puts no trust in His servants,If He charges His angels with error,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>How much more those who dwell in houses of clay,Whose foundation is in the dust,Who are crushed before a moth?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>They are broken in pieces from morning till evening;They perish forever, with no one regarding.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Does not their own excellence go away?They die, even without wisdom.'</p>
