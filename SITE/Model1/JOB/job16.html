<h2> Job 16 </h2>


<h4>Job Reproaches His Pitiless Friends</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Then Job answered and said:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>�I have heard many such things;Miserable comforters are you all!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Shall words of wind have an end?Or what provokes you that you answer?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>I also could speak as you do,If your soul were in my soul�s place.I could heap up words against you,And shake my head at you;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>But I would strengthen you with my mouth,And the comfort of my lips would relieve your grief.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>�Though I speak, my grief is not relieved;And if I remain silent, how am I eased?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>But now He has worn me out;You have made desolate all my company.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>You have shriveled me up,And it is a witness against me;My leanness rises up against meAnd bears witness to my face.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>He tears me in His wrath, and hates me;He gnashes at me with His teeth;My adversary sharpens His gaze on me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>They gape at me with their mouth,They strike me reproachfully on the cheek,They gather together against me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>God has delivered me to the ungodly,And turned me over to the hands of the wicked.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>I was at ease, but He has shattered me;He also has taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces;He has set me up for His target,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>His archers surround me.He pierces my heart and does not pity;He pours out my gall on the ground.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>He breaks me with wound upon wound;He runs at me like a warrior.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>�I have sewn sackcloth over my skin,And laid my head in the dust.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>My face is flushed from weeping,And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Although no violence is in my hands,And my prayer is pure.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>�O earth, do not cover my blood,And let my cry have no resting place!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Surely even now my witness is in heaven,And my evidence is on high.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>My friends scorn me;My eyes pour out tears to God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Oh, that one might plead for a man with God,As a man pleads for hi neighbor!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>For when a few years are finished,I shall go the way of no return.</p>
