<h2> Job 12 </h2>


<h4>Job Answers His Critics</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Then Job answered and said:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>�No doubt you are the people,And wisdom will die with you!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>But I have understanding as well as you;I am not inferior to you.Indeed, who does not know such things as these?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>�I am one mocked by his friends,Who called on God, and He answered him,The just and blameless who is ridiculed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>A lamp is despised in the thought of one who is at ease;It is made ready for those whose feet slip.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>The tents of robbers prosper,And those who provoke God are secure�In what God provides by His hand.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>�But now ask the beasts, and they will teach you;And the birds of the air, and they will tell you;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you;And the fish of the sea will explain to you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Who among all these does not knowThat the hand of the Lord has done this,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>In whose hand is the life of every living thing,And the breath of all mankind?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>1Does not the ear test wordsAnd the mouth taste its food?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Wisdom is with aged men,And with length of days, understanding.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>�With Him are wisdom and strength,He has counsel and understanding.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>If He breaks a thing down, it cannot be rebuilt;If He imprisons a man, there can be no release.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>If He withholds the waters, they dry up;If He sends them out, they overwhelm the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>With Him are strength and prudence.The deceived and the deceiver are His.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>He leads counselors away plundered,And makes fools of the judges.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>He loosens the bonds of kings,And binds their waist with a belt.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>He leads princes away plundered,And overthrows the mighty.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>He deprives the trusted ones of speech,And takes away the discernment of the elders.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>He pours contempt on princes,And disarms the mighty.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>He uncovers deep things out of darkness,And brings the shadow of death to light.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>He makes nations great, and destroys them;He enlarges nations, and guides them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>He takes away the understanding of the chiefs of the people of the earth,And makes them wander in a pathless wilderness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>They grope in the dark without light,And He makes them stagger like a drunken man.</p>
