<h2> Job 13 </h2>


<h4>Job Defends Himself</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>"Behold, my eye has seen all this,My ear has heard and understood it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>What you know, I also know;I am not inferior to you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>But I would speak to the Almighty,And I desire to reason with God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>But you forgers of lies,You are all worthless physicians.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Oh, that you would be silent,And it would be your wisdom!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Now hear my reasoning,And heed the pleadings of my lips.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Will you speak wickedly for God,And talk deceitfully for Him?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Will you show partiality for Him?Will you contend for God?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Will it be well when He searches you out?Or can you mock Him as one mocks a man?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>He will surely rebuke youIf you secretly show partiality.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Will not His excellence make you afraid,And the dread of Him fall upon you?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Your platitudes are proverbs of ashes,Your defenses are defenses of clay.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>"Hold your peace with me, and let me speak,Then let come on me what may!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Why do I take my flesh in my teeth,And put my life in my hands?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him.Even so, I will defend my own ways before Him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>He also shall be my salvation,For a hypocrite could not come before Him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Listen carefully to my speech,And to my declaration with your ears.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>See now, I have prepared my case,I know that I shall be vindicated.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Who is he who will contend with me?If now I hold my tongue, I perish.</p>
<h4>Job's Despondent Prayer</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>:"Only two things do not do to me,Then I will not hide myself from You:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Withdraw Your hand far from me,And let not the dread of You make me afraid.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Then call, and I will answer;Or let me speak, then You respond to me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>How many are my iniquities and sins?Make me know my transgression and my sin.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>Why do You hide Your face,And regard me as Your enemy?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Will You frighten a leaf driven to and fro?And will You pursue dry stubble?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>For You write bitter things against me,And make me inherit the iniquities of my youth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>You put my feet in the stocks,And watch closely all my paths.You set a limit for the soles of my feet.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/13-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>"Man decays like a rotten thing,Like a garment that is moth-eaten.</p>
