<h2> Job 7 </h2>


<h4>God�s Power in the Leviathan</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>�Can you draw out Leviathan with a hook,Or snare his tongue with a line which you lower?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Can you put a reed through his nose,Or pierce his jaw with a hook?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Will he make many supplications to you?Will he speak softly to you?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Will he make a covenant with you?Will you take him as a servant forever?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Will you play with him as with a bird,Or will you leash him for your maidens?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Will your companions make a banquet of him?Will they apportion him among the merchants?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Can you fill his skin with harpoons,Or his head with fishing spears?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Lay your hand on him;Remember the battle�Never do it again!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Indeed, any hope of overcoming him is false;Shall one not be overwhelmed at the sight of him?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>No one is so fierce that he would dare stir him up.Who then is able to stand against Me?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Who has preceded Me, that I should pay him?Everything under heaven is Mine.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>�I will not conceal his limbs,His mighty power, or his graceful proportions.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Who can remove his outer coat?Who can approach him with a double bridle?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Who can open the doors of his face,With his terrible teeth all around?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>His rows of scales are his pride,Shut up tightly as with a seal;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>One is so near anotherThat no air can come between them;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>They are joined one to another,They stick together and cannot be parted.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>His sneezings flash forth light,And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Out of his mouth go burning lights;Sparks of fire shoot out.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Smoke goes out of his nostrils,As from a boiling pot and burning rushes.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>His breath kindles coals,And a flame goes out of his mouth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Strength dwells in his neck,And sorrow dances before him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>The folds of his flesh are joined together;They are firm on him and cannot be moved.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>His heart is as hard as stone,Even as hard as the lower millstone.
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid;Because of his crashings they are beside themselves.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>Though the sword reaches him, it cannot avail;Nor does spear, dart, or javelin.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>He regards iron as straw,And bronze as rotten wood.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>The arrow cannot make him flee;Slingstones become like stubble to him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>Darts are regarded as straw;He laughs at the threat of javelins.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>His undersides are like sharp potsherds;He spreads pointed marks in the mire.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>He makes the deep boil like a pot;He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>He leaves a shining wake behind him;One would think the deep had white hair.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>On earth there is nothing like him,Which is made without fear.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>He beholds every high thing;He is king over all the children of pride.�</p>
