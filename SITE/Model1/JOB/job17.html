<h2> Job 17 </h2>


<h4>Job Prays for Relief</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>"My spirit is broken,My days are extinguished,The grave is ready for me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Are not mockers with me?And does not my eye dwell on their provocation?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>"Now put down a pledge for me with Yourself.Who is he who will shake hands with me?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>For You have hidden their heart from understanding;Therefore You will not exalt them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>He who speaks flattery to his friends,Even the eyes of his children will fail.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>"But He has made me a byword of the people,And I have become one in whose face men spit.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>My eye has also grown dim because of sorrow,And all my members are like shadows.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Upright men are astonished at this,And the innocent stirs himself up against the hypocrite.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Yet the righteous will hold to his way,And he who has clean hands will be stronger and stronger.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>"But please, come back again, all of you,For I shall not find one wise man among you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>My days are past,My purposes are broken off,Even the thoughts of my heart.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>They change the night into day;"The light is near," they say, in the face of darkness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>If I wait for the grave as my house,If I make my bed in the darkness,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>If I say to corruption, "You are my father,"And to the worm,"You are my mother and my sister,"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Where then is my hope?As for my hope, who can see it?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Will they go down to the gates of Sheol?Shall we have rest together in the dust?"</p>
