<h2> 1Corinthians 3 </h2>

<h4> Sectarianism Is Carnal  </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual people but as to carnal, as to babes in Christ. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>I fed you with milk and not with solid food; for until now you were not able to receive it, and even now you are still not able;
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>for you are still carnal. For where there are envy, strife, and divisions among you, are you not carnal and behaving like mere men? 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>For when one says, “I am of Paul,” and another, “I am of Apollos,” are you not carnal?</p>
<h4> Watering, Working, Warning  </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers through whom you believed, as the Lord gave to each one?
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, you are God’s building.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation, and another builds on it. But let each one take heed how he builds on it. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Now if anyone builds on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>each one’s work will become clear; for the Day will declare it, because it will be revealed by fire; and the fire will test each one’s work, of what sort it is. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>If anyone’s work which he has built on it endures, he will receive a reward. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>If anyone’s work is burned, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>If anyone defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which temple you are.</p>
<h4>  Avoid Worldly Wisdom </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise.
 <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, “He catches the wise in their own craftiness”;
 <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>and again, “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.” </p> 
 <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours:
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world or life or death, or things present or things to come—all are yours. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>And you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.</p>
