<h2> 1Corinthians 12 </h2>

<h4> Spiritual Gifts: Unity in Diversity  </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want you to be ignorant:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>You know that you were Gentiles, carried away to these dumb idols, however you were led. </p>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed, and no one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. </p>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all. </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all: </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>for to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another the word of knowledge through the same Spirit, </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit, </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills.</p>
<h4> Unity and Diversity in One Body  </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>For as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free—and have all been made to drink into one Spirit. </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>For in fact the body is not one member but many.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body,” is it therefore not of the body?</p>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body,” is it therefore not of the body? </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>If the whole body were an eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling? </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body just as He pleased. </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>And if they were all one member, where would the body be?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>But now indeed there are many members, yet one body. </p>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>And the eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you”; nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.” </p>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.</p>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>And those members of the body which we think to be less honorable, on these we bestow greater honor; and our unpresentable parts have greater modesty,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>but our presentable parts have no need. But God composed the body, having given greater honor to that part which lacks it, </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>that there should be no schism in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another. </p>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles? 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>But earnestly desire the [i]best gifts. And yet I show you a more excellent way. </p>
