<h2> 1Corinthians 13 </h2>

<h4>  The Greatest Gift </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Love never fails. But whether there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will vanish away.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>For we know in part and we prophesy in part.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love</p>
