<h2> 1Corinthians 11 </h2>

<h4> Worship and the Lord’s Supper  </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Imitate me, just as I also imitate Christ.</p>
<h4>Head Coverings </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things and keep the traditions just as I delivered them to you. 
 <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>But I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, the head of woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, for that is one and the same as if her head were shaved. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>For man is not from woman, but woman from man.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Nor was man created for the woman, but woman for the man.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a> For this reason the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Nevertheless, neither is man independent of woman, nor woman independent of man, in the Lord.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>For as woman came from man, even so man also comes through woman; but all things are from God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Judge among yourselves. Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him? 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her for a covering. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor do the churches of God.</p>
<h4> Conduct at the Lord’s Supper  </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Now in giving these instructions I do not praise you, since you come together not for the better but for the worse. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>For first of all, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>For there must also be factions among you, that those who are approved may be recognized among you.</p>
 <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Therefore when you come together in one place, it is not to eat the Lord’s Supper. 
 <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>For in eating, each one takes his own supper ahead of others; and one is hungry and another is drunk. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I do not praise you.</p>
<h4> Institution of the Lord’s Supper  </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: that the Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread; 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said,<a style="color: #770000;"> “Take, eat; this is My body which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.” </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>In the same manner He also took the cup after supper, saying,<a style="color: #770000;"> “This cup is the new covenant in My blood. This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.”</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death till He comes.</p>
<h4> Examine Yourself  </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>For this reason many are weak and sick among you, and many sleep. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>For if we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>Therefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest you come together for judgment. And the rest I will set in order when I come.</p>
