<h2>1Corinthians 16  </h2>
<h4> Collection for the Saints  </h4>  



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given orders to the churches of Galatia, so you must do also: 
 <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>On the first day of the week let each one of you lay something aside, storing up as he may prosper, that there be no collections when I come. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>And when I come, whomever you approve by your letters I will send to bear your gift to Jerusalem. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>But if it is fitting that I go also, they will go with me.</p>
<h4>  Personal Plans </h4> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Now I will come to you when I pass through Macedonia (for I am passing through Macedonia). 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>And it may be that I will remain, or even spend the winter with you, that you may send me on my journey, wherever I go. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>For I do not wish to see you now on the way; but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>But I will tarry in Ephesus until Pentecost. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>For a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>And if Timothy comes, see that he may be with you without fear; for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do. </p>
 <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Therefore let no one despise him. But send him on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I am waiting for him with the brethren.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brethren, but he was quite unwilling to come at this time; however, he will come when he has a convenient time.</p>
<h4> Final Exhortations  </h4>  
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Watch, stand fast in the faith, be brave, be strong. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Let all that you do be done with love.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>I urge you, brethren—you know the household of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to the ministry of the saints— 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>that you also submit to such, and to everyone who works and labors with us.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>I am glad about the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, for what was lacking on your part they supplied. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge such men.</p>
<h4>  Greetings and a Solemn Farewell </h4>  
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you heartily in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>All the brethren greet you.Greet one another with a holy kiss.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>The salutation with my own hand—Paul’s.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. O Lord, come!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>
