<h2> LUKE 16 </h2>


<h4>The Parable of the Unjust Steward</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>He also said to His disciples: 'There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and an accusation was brought to him that this man was wasting his goods.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a><a style="color:#770000;">So he called him and said to him, 'What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward."</a></p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a><a style="color:#770000;">'Then the steward said within himself, "What shall I do? For my master is taking the stewardship away from me. I cannot dig; I am ashamed to beg.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a><a style="color:#770000;">I have resolved what to do, that when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses."</a></p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a><a style="color:#770000;">"So he called every one of his master's debtors to him, and said to the first,"How much do you owe my master?"</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a><a style="color:#770000;">And he said, "A hundred measures of oil." So he said to him, "Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty."</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a><a style="color:#770000;">"Then he said to another,"And how much do you owe?" So he said, "A hundred measures of wheat." And he said to him, "Take your bill, and write eighty." 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a><a style="color:#770000;">So the master commended the unjust steward because he had dealt shrewdly. For the sons of this world are more shrewd in their generation than the sons of light.</a>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a><a style="color:#770000;">"And I say to you, make friends for yourselves by unrighteous mammon, that when you fail, they may receive you into an everlasting home.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a><a style="color:#770000;">He who is faithful in what is least is faithful also in much; and he who is unjust in what is least is unjust also in much.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a><a style="color:#770000;">Therefore if you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a><a style="color:#770000;">And if you have not been faithful in what is another man's, who will give you what is your own?</a></p>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a><a style="color:#770000;">"No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon."</a></p>

<h4>The Law, the Prophets, and the Kingdom</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they derided Him.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>And He said to them,<a style="color:#770000;">"You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God.</a></p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a><a style="color:#770000;">"The law and the prophets were until John. Since that time the kingdom of God has been preached, and everyone is pressing into it.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a><a style="color:#770000;">And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one tittle of the law to fail.</a>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a><a style="color:#770000;">"Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is divorced from her husband commits adultery.</a></p>

<h4>The Rich Man and Lazarus</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a><a style="color:#770000;">"There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day. </a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a><a style="color:#770000;">But there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, full of sores, who was laid at his gate,</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a><a style="color:#770000;">desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table. Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a><a style="color:#770000;">So it was that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died and was buried.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a><a style="color:#770000;">And being in torments in Hades, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</a></p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a><a style="color:#770000;">"Then he cried and said, "Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame." </a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a><a style="color:#770000;">But Abraham said, "Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted and you are tormented.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a><a style="color:#770000;">And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, so that those who want to pass from here to you cannot, nor can those from there pass to us."</a></p>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a><a style="color:#770000;">"Then he said,"I beg you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father's house,</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a><a style="color:#770000;">for I have five brothers, that he may testify to them, lest they also come to this place of torment." </a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a><a style="color:#770000;">Abraham said to him,"They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them."</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a><a style="color:#770000;">And he said,"No, father Abraham; but if one goes to them from the dead, they will repent."</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a><a style="color:#770000;">But he said to him, "If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one rise from the dead.'",</a></p>
