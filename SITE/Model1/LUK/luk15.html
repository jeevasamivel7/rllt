<h2> LUKE 15 </h2>



<h4>The Parable of the Lost Sheep</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Then all the tax collectors and the sinners drew near to Him to hear Him.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>And the Pharisees and scribes complained, saying, “This Man receives sinners and eats with them.” 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>So He spoke this parable to them, saying:</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a><a style="color:#770000;">“What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a><a style="color:#770000;">And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.</a> 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a><a style="color:#770000;">And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!’ </a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a><a style="color:#770000;">I say to you that likewise there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance.</a></p>


<h4>The Parable of the Lost Coin</h4>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a><a style="color:#770000;">“Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it?</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-9.htm" target="_blank"></a><a style="color:#770000;">And when she has found it, she calls her friends and neighbors together, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I lost!’</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a><a style="color:#770000;">Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”</a></p>


<h4>The Parable of the Lost Son</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a><a style="color:#770000;">Then He said: “A certain man had two sons.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a><a style="color:#770000;">And the younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me.’ So he divided to them his livelihood. </a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a><a style="color:#770000;">And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, journeyed to a far country, and there wasted his possessions with  prodigal living.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a><a style="color:#770000;">But when he had spent all, there arose a severe famine in that land, and he began to be in want.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a><a style="color:#770000;">Then he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a><a style="color:#770000;">And he would gladly have filled his stomach with the pods that the swine ate, and no one gave him anything.</a></p>




<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a><a style="color:#770000;">“But when he came to himself, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! </a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a><a style="color:#770000;">I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you, </a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a><a style="color:#770000;">and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.” ’</a></p>

 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a><a style="color:#770000;">“And he arose and came to his father. But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. </a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a><a style="color:#770000;">And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.’</a></p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a><a style="color:#770000;">“But the father said to his servants,‘Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a><a style="color:#770000;">And bring the fatted calf here and kill it, and let us eat and be merry;</a>


 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a><a style="color:#770000;">for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ And they began to be merry.</a></p>


<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a><a style="color:#770000;">“Now his older son was in the field. And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing. </a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a><a style="color:#770000;">So he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a><a style="color:#770000;">And he said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and because he has received him safe and sound, your father has killed the fatted calf.’</a>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a><a style="color:#770000;">“But he was angry and would not go in. Therefore his father came out and pleaded with him. </a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a><a style="color:#770000;">So he answered and said to his father, ‘Lo, these many years I have been serving you; I never transgressed your commandment at any time; and yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my friends.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a><a style="color:#770000;">But as soon as this son of yours came, who has devoured your livelihood with harlots, you killed the fatted calf for him.’</a></p>


<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a><a style="color:#770000;">“And he said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a><a style="color:#770000;">It was right that we should make merry and be glad, for your brother was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found.’ ”</a></p>
