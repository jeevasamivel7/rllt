<h2> Luke 22 </h2>


<h4>The Plot to Kill Jesus</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread drew near, which is called Passover.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might kill Him, for they feared the people.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Then Satan entered Judas, surnamed Iscariot, who was numbered among the twelve. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>So he went his way and conferred with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray Him to them.,</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>And they were glad, and agreed to give him money.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>So he promised and sought opportunity to betray Him to them in the absence of the multitude.</p>


<h4>Jesus and His Disciples Prepare the Passover</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Then came the Day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover must be killed. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>And He sent Peter and John, saying,<a style="color:#770000;">�Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.�,</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>So they said to Him, �Where do You want us to prepare?�</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>And He said to them,<a style="color:#770000;"> �Behold, when you have entered the city, a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him into the house which he enters.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a></p><a style="color:#770000;">Then you shall say to the master of the house, �The Teacher says to you, �Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?� �</a> </p>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a><a style="color:#770000;">Then he will show you a large, furnished upper room; there make ready.�</a>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>So they went and found it just as He had said to them, and they prepared the Passover.</p>



<h4>Jesus Institutes the Lord�s Supper</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>When the hour had come, He sat down, and the twelve apostles with Him.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a> Then He said to them,<a style="color:#770000;"> �With fervent desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; </a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a><a style="color:#770000;">for I say to you, I will no longer eat of it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.�</a></p>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and said,<a style="color:#770000;"> �Take this and divide it among yourselves;</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a><a style="color:#770000;">for I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.�</a>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>And He took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying,<a style="color:#770000;"> �This is My body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.�</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Likewise He also took the cup after supper, saying, <a style="color:#770000;">�This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is shed for you.</a></p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a><a style="color:#770000;">But behold, the hand of My betrayer is with Me on the table.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a><a style="color:#770000;">And truly the Son of Man goes as it has been determined, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!�</a></p>




<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Then they began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing.</p>

<h4>The Disciples Argue About Greatness</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a> Now there was also a dispute among them, as to which of them should be considered the greatest. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>And He said to them,<a style="color:#770000;"> �The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those who exercise authority over them are called �benefactors.�</p.
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a><a style="color:#770000;">But not so among you; on the contrary, he who is greatest among you, let him be as the younger, and he who governs as he who serves.</a> </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a><a style="color:#770000;">For who is greater, he who sits at the table, or he who serves? Is it not he who sits at the table? Yet I am among you as the One who serves.</a></p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a><a style="color:#770000;">�But you are those who have continued with Me in My trials.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a><a style="color:#770000;">And I bestow upon you a kingdom, just as My Father bestowed one upon Me,</a> 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a><a style="color:#770000;">that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.�</a></p>


<h4>Jesus Predicts Peter�s Denial</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>And the Lord said,<a style="color:#770000;"> �Simon, Simon! Indeed, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat.</a> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a><a style="color:#770000;">But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.�</a></p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a> But he said to Him, �Lord, I am ready to go with You, both to prison and to death.�</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>Then He said, <a style="color:#770000;">�I tell you, Peter, the rooster shall not crow this day before you will deny three times that you know Me.�</a></p>


<h4>suppies for thr Road</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a>And He said to them, <a style="color:#770000;">�When I sent you without money bag, knapsack, and sandals, did you lack anything?�So they said, �Nothing.�</a> </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-36.htm" target="_blank">36</a>Then He said to them,<a style="color:#770000;"> �But now, he who has a money bag, let him take it, and likewise a knapsack; and he who has no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one.</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-37.htm" target="_blank">37</a><a style="color:#770000;">For I say to you that this which is written must still be accomplished in Me: �And He was numbered with the transgressors.� For the things concerning Me have an end.�</a></a></p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-38.htm" target="_blank">38</a>So they said, �Lord, look, here are two swords.�And He said to them,<a style="color:#770000;"> �It is enough.�</a></p>


<h4>The Prayer in the Garden</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-39.htm" target="_blank">39</a>Coming out, He went to the Mount of Olives, as He was accustomed, and His disciples also followed Him. </p>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-40.htm" target="_blank">40</a>When He came to the place, He said to them,<a style="color:#770000;"> �Pray that you may not enter into temptation.�</a></p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-41.htm" target="_blank">41</a>And He was withdrawn from them about a stone�s throw, and He knelt down and prayed, 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-42.htm" target="_blank">42</a>saying, <a style="color:#770000;">"Father,if it is your will,take this cup away from Me;nevertheless not My will,but yours,be done."</a>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-43.htm" target="_blank">43</a>Then an angel appeared to Him from heaven, strengthening Him.
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-44.htm" target="_blank">44</a>And being in agony, He prayed more earnestly. Then His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-45.htm" target="_blank">45</a>When He rose up from prayer, and had come to His disciples, He found them sleeping from sorrow.
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-46.htm" target="_blank">46</a>Then He said to them,<a style="color:#770000;"> �Why do you sleep? Rise and pray, lest you enter into temptation.�</a></p>

<h4>Betrayal and Arrest in Gethsemane</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-47.htm" target="_blank">47</a>And while He was still speaking, behold, a multitude; and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them and drew near to Jesus to kiss Him.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-48.htm" target="_blank">48</a>But Jesus said to him,<a style="color:#770000;"> �Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?�</a></p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-49.htm" target="_blank">49</a>When those around Him saw what was going to happen, they said to Him, �Lord, shall we strike with the sword?�
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-50.htm" target="_blank">50</a>And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-51.htm" target="_blank">51</a>But Jesus answered and said,<a style="color:#770000;"> �Permit even this.� </a>And He touched his ear and healed him.
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-52.htm" target="_blank">52</a>Then Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and the elders who had come to Him,<a style="color:#770000;"> �Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs?</a></p>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-53.htm" target="_blank">53</a><a style="color:#770000;">When I was with you daily in the temple, you did not try to seize Me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.�</a></p>


<h4>Peter Denies Jesus, and Weeps Bitterly</h4>




<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-54.htm" target="_blank">54</a>Having arrested Him, they led Him and brought Him into the high priest�s house. But Peter followed at a distance.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-55.htm" target="_blank">55</a>Now when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them.</p>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-56.htm" target="_blank">56</a>And a certain servant girl, seeing him as he sat by the fire, looked intently at him and said, �This man was also with Him.�</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-57.htm" target="_blank">57</a>But he denied Him, saying, �Woman, I do not know Him.�</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-58.htm" target="_blank">58</a>And after a little while another saw him and said, �You also are of them.�But Peter said, �Man, I am not!�</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-59.htm" target="_blank">59</a>Then after about an hour had passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, �Surely this fellow also was with Him, for he is a Galilean.�</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-60.htm" target="_blank">60</a>But Peter said, �Man, I do not know what you are saying!�Immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-61.htm" target="_blank">61</a><a style="color:#770000;">And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, �Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.</a>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-62.htm" target="_blank">62</a>So Peter went out and wept bitterly.</P>


<h4>Jesus Mocked and Beaten</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-63.htm" target="_blank">63</a>Now the men who held Jesus mocked Him and beat Him.
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-64.htm" target="_blank">64</a>And having blindfolded Him, they struck Him on the face and asked Him, saying, �Prophesy! Who is the one who struck You?�
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-65.htm" target="_blank">65</a>And many other things they blasphemously spoke against Him.</P>



<h4>Jesus Faces the Sanhedrin</h4>




<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-66.htm" target="_blank">66</a>As soon as it was day, the elders of the people, both chief priests and scribes, came together and led Him into their council, saying,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-67.htm" target="_blank">67</a>"If You are the Christ, tell us."But He said to them, <a style="color:#770000;">�If I tell you, you will by no means believe</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-68.htm" target="_blank">68</a><a style="color:#770000;">And if I also ask you, you will by no means answer Me or let Me go.</a></a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-69.htm" target="_blank">69</a><a style="color:#770000;">Hereafter the Son of Man will sit on the right hand of the power of God.�</a></P>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-70.htm" target="_blank">70</a>Then they all said, �Are You then the Son of God?�So He said to them,<a style="color:#770000;"> �You rightly say that I am.�</a></P>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-71.htm" target="_blank">71</a>And they said, �What further testimony do we need? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth.�</P>
