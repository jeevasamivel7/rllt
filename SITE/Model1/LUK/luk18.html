<h2> LUKE 18 </h2>


The Parable of the Persistent Widow
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Then He spoke a parable to them, that men always ought to pray and not lose heart,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>saying:<a style="color:#770000;"> "There was in a certain city a judge who did not fear God nor regard man.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a><a style="color:#770000;">Now there was a widow in that city; and she came to him, saying,"Get justice for me from my adversary."</p>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a><a style="color:#770000;">And he would not for a while; but afterward he said within himself, "Though I do not fear God nor regard man,</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a><a style="color:#770000;">yet because this widow troubles me I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.'"</a></p></a>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Then the Lord said,<a style="color:#770000;"> "Hear what the unjust judge said.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a><a style="color:#770000;">And shall God not avenge His own elect who cry out day and night to Him, though He bears long with them?</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a><a style="color:#770000;">I tell you that He will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He really find faith on the earth?"</p></a>


<h2>The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector </h2>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Also He spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a><a style="color:#770000;">"Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. </p></a>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a><a style="color:#770000;">The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, "God, I thank You that I am not like other men"extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a><a style="color:#770000;">I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I possess."</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a><a style="color:#770000;">And the tax collector, standing afar off, would not so much as raise his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying,"God, be merciful to me a sinner!"</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a><a style="color:#770000;">I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."</p></a>

<h2>Jesus Blesses Little Children</h2>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Then they also brought infants to Him that He might touch them; but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>But Jesus called them to Him and said,<a style="color:#770000;"> "Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of God.</a></p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a><a style="color:#770000;">Assuredly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it."</a></p>

<h2>Jesus Counsels the Rich Young Ruler</h2>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Now a certain ruler asked Him, saying, "Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>So Jesus said to him,<a style="color:#770000;"> "Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, that is, God.</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a><a style="color:#770000;">You know the commandments:"Do not commit adultery,'"Do not murder,'"Do not steal,'"Do not bear false witness,'"Honor your father and your mother.'"</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>And he said, "All these things I have kept from my youth."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>So when Jesus heard these things, He said to him, <a style="color:#770000;">"You still lack one thing. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me."</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>But when he heard this, he became very sorrowful, for he was very rich.</p>

<h2>With God All Things Are Possible</h2>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>And when Jesus saw that he became very sorrowful, He said,<a style="color:#770000;">"How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a><a style="color:#770000;">For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."</a></p>




<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>And those who heard it said, "Who then can be saved?"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>But He said,<a style="color:#770000;">"The things which are impossible with men are possible with God."</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>Then Peter said, "See, we have left all and followed You."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>So He said to them, <a style="color:#770000;">"Assuredly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or parents or brothers or wife or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,</a></p>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a><a style="color:#770000;">who shall not receive many times more in this present time, and in the age to come eternal life."</a></p>



<h2>Jesus a Third Time Predicts His Death and Resurrection</h2>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>Then He took the twelve aside and said to them,<a style="color:#770000;">"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be accomplished.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a><a style="color:#770000;">For He will be delivered to the Gentiles and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a><a style="color:#770000;">They will scourge Him and kill Him. And the third day He will rise again."</a></p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>But they understood none of these things; this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know the things which were spoken.</p>



<h2>A Blind Man Receives His Sight</h2>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a>Then it happened, as He was coming near Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the road begging.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-36.htm" target="_blank">36</a>And hearing a multitude passing by, he asked what it meant.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-37.htm" target="_blank">37</a>So they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-38.htm" target="_blank">38</a>And he cried out, saying, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-39.htm" target="_blank">39</a>Then those who went before warned him that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more,"Son of David, have mercy on me!"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-40.htm" target="_blank">40</a>So Jesus stood still and commanded him to be brought to Him. And when he had come near, He asked him, 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-41.htm" target="_blank">41</a>saying,<a style="color:#770000;">"What do you want Me to do for you?"</a>He said, "Lord, that I may receive my sight."</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-42.htm" target="_blank">42</a>Then Jesus said to him, <a style="color:#770000;">"Receive your sight; your faith has made you well."</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-43.htm" target="_blank">43</a>And immediately he received his sight, and followed Him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.</p>
