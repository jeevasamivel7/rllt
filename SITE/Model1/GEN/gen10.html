<h2>Genesis 11</h2>


<h4>The Tower of Babel</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Now the whole earth had one language and one speech. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Then they said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They had brick for stone, and they had asphalt for mortar.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>And they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top is in the heavens; let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.”</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>And the Lord said, “Indeed the people are one and they all have one language, and this is what they begin to do; now nothing that they propose to do will be withheld from them.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.”
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>So the Lord scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they ceased building the city. 
   <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Therefore its name is called Babel, because there the Lord confused the language of all the earth; and from there the Lord scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>And Haran died before his father Terah in his native land, in Ur of the Chaldeans. </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>Then Abram and Nahor took wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah. </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>But Sarai was barren; she had no child.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>And Terah took his son Abram and his grandson Lot, the son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, his son Abram’s wife, and they went out with them from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan; and they  came to Haran and dwelt there. </p>
