<h2>Genesis 10</h2>


<h4>Nations Descended from Noah</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Now this is the genealogy of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And sons were born to them after the flood.</p>

 <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>The sons of Japheth were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>The sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>The sons of Javan were Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>From these the coastland peoples of the Gentiles were separated into their lands, everyone according to his language, according to their families, into their nations. </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>The sons of Ham were Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>The sons of Cush were Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabtechah; and the sons of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Cush begot Nimrod; he began to be a mighty one on the earth. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>He was a mighty hunter before the Lord; therefore it is said, “Like Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord.” 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>From that land he went to Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (that is the principal city).</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Mizraim begot Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Pathrusim, and Casluhim (from whom came the Philistines and Caphtorim).</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Canaan begot Sidon his firstborn, and Heth;  
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>the Jebusite, the Amorite, and the Girgashite;
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>the Hivite, the Arkite, and the Sinite; 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>the Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were dispersed. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon as you go toward Gerar, as far as Gaza; then as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>These were the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their languages, in their lands and in their nations.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>And children were born also to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>The sons of Shem were Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>The sons of Aram were Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>Arphaxad begot Salah, and Salah begot Eber. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>To Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided; and his brother’s name was Joktan. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>Joktan begot Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>And their dwelling place was from Mesha as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>These were the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their languages, in their lands, according to their nations.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>These were the families of the sons of Noah, according to their generations, in their nations; and from these the nations were divided on the earth after the flood.</p>
