<h2> Galatians 6 </h2>
<h4>Bear and Share Burdens </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Brethren, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, considering yourself lest you also be tempted.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>For if anyone thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>But let each one examine his own work, and then he will have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>For each one shall bear his own load.</p>
<h4>Be Generous and Do Good </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Let him who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.</p>
<h4> Glory Only in the Cross</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand! 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>As many as desire to make a good showing in the flesh, these would compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>For not even those who are circumcised keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>But God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but a new creation.</p>
<h4>Blessing and a Plea </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>And as many as walk according to this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>From now on let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
