<h2>Galatians 5 </h2>
<h4> Christian Liberty</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing. <
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to keep the whole law.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>You have become estranged from Christ, you who attempt to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>For we through the Spirit eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love.</p>
<h4>Love Fulfills the Law </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>You ran well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth?
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>This persuasion does not come from Him who calls you. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>A little leaven leavens the whole lump. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>I have confidence in you, in the Lord, that you will have no other mind; but he who troubles you shall bear his judgment, whoever he is.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>And I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why do I still suffer persecution? Then the offense of the cross has ceased. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>I could wish that those who trouble you would even cut themselves off!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not use liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>But if you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another!</p>
<h4> Walking in the Spirit</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>And those who are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.</p>
