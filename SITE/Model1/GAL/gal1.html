<h2>Galaians 1  </h2>
<h4>  Greeting </h4>  

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Paul, an apostle (not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Him from the dead), 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>and all the brethren who are with me, To the churches of Galatia: </p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>who gave Himself for our sins, that He might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<h4>  Only One Gospel </h4> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ.</p>
<h4> Call to Apostleship  </h4> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>But I make known to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came through the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>And I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me through His grace, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately confer with flesh and blood, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.</p>
<h4>  Contacts at Jerusalem </h4> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and remained with him fifteen days. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord’s brother.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>(Now concerning the things which I write to you, indeed, before God, I do not lie.)</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Afterward I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which were in Christ. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>But they were hearing only, “He who formerly persecuted us now preaches the faith which he once tried to destroy.”
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>And they glorified God in me.</p>
