<h4>The Promise of Rest</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Therefore, since a promise remains of entering His rest, let us fear lest any of you seem to have come short of it. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>For indeed the gospel was preached to us as well as to them; but the word which they heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard it. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>For we who have believed do enter that rest, as He has said:“So I swore in My wrath,‘They shall not enter My rest,’ ”although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>For He has spoken in a certain place of the seventh day in this way: “And God rested on the seventh day from all His works”;
<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>and again in this place: “They shall not enter My rest.”</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Since therefore it remains that some must enter it, and those to whom it was first preached did not enter because of disobedience, 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>again He designates a certain day, saying in David, “Today,” after such a long time, as it has been said:“Today, if you will hear His voice,Do not harden your hearts.”</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>For if Joshua had given them rest, then He would not afterward have spoken of another day.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>There remains therefore a rest for the people of God. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God did from His.</p>


<h4>The Word Discovers Our Condition</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest, lest anyone fall according to the same example of disobedience.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.</p>


<h4>Our Compassionate High Priest</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</p>
