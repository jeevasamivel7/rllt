<h2>Hebrew3</h2>


<h4>The Son Was Faithful</h4>




<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Christ Jesus,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>who was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was faithful in all His house. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>For this One has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as He who built the house has more honor than the house.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>For every house is built by someone, but He who built all things is God. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>And Moses indeed was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which would be spoken afterward,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>but Christ as a Son over His own house, whose house we are if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.</p>

<h4>Be Faithful</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says:“Today, if you will hear His voice,</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,In the day of trial in the wilderness,</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Where your fathers tested Me, tried Me,And saw My works forty years.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Therefore I was angry with that generation,And said, ‘They always go astray in their heart,And they have not known My ways.’</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>So I swore in My wrath,‘They shall not enter My rest.’ ”</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Beware, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God; 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>but exhort one another daily, while it is called “Today,” lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>For we have become partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end, </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>while it is said:“Today, if you will hear His voice,Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”</p>


<h4>Failure of the Wilderness Wanderers</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>For who, having heard, rebelled? Indeed, was it not all who came out of Egypt, led by Moses?
<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Now with whom was He angry forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose corpses fell in the wilderness?
<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who did not obey?
<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</p>
