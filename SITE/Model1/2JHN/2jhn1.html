<h2>2John1</h2>


<h4>Greeting the Elect Lady</h4>


<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>The Elder,To the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all those who have known the truth,</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>because of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever:</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Grace, mercy, and peace will be with you from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</p>

<h4>Walk in Christ’s Commandments</h4>



<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>I rejoiced greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, as we received commandment from the Father.</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>And now I plead with you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we have had from the beginning: that we love one another.</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>This is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, that as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in it.</p>

<h4>Beware of Antichrist Deceivers</h4>




<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>For many deceivers have gone out into the world who do not confess Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Look to yourselves, that we do not lose those things we worked for, but that we may receive a full reward.</p>


<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house nor greet him;
<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>for he who greets him shares in his evil deeds.</p>


<h4>John’s Farewell Greeting</h4>



<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Having many things to write to you, I did not wish to do so with paper and ink; but I hope to come to you and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>The children of your elect sister greet you. Amen.</p>
