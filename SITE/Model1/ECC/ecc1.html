<h2>Ecclesiastes 1</h2>


<h4>The Vanity of Life</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>“Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher;
“Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>What profit has a man from all his labor
In which he toils under the sun?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>One generation passes away, and another generation comes;
But the earth abides forever.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>The sun also rises, and the sun goes down,
And hastens to the place where it arose.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>The wind goes toward the south,And turns around to the north;The wind whirls about continually,And comes again on its circuit.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>All the rivers run into the sea,Yet the sea is not full;To the place from which the rivers come,There they return again.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>All things are full of labor;Man cannot express it.The eye is not satisfied with seeing,Nor the ear filled with hearing.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>That which has been is what will be,That which is done is what will be done,And there is nothing new under the sun.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Is there anything of which it may be said,“See, this is new”?It has already been in ancient times before us.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>There is no remembrance of former things,Nor will there be any remembrance of things that are to come By those who will come after.</p>
<h4>The Grief of Wisdom</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>And I set my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven; this burdensome task God has given to the sons of man, by which they may be exercised. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and indeed, all is vanity and grasping for the wind.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>What is crooked cannot be made straight,
And what is lacking cannot be numbered.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>I communed with my heart, saying, “Look, I have attained greatness, and have gained more wisdom than all who were before me in Jerusalem. My heart has [f]understood great wisdom and knowledge.” 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>And I set my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is grasping for the wind.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>For in much wisdom is much grief,
And he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.</p>
