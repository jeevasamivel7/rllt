        <h2>Ecclesiastes 10</h2>

        <h4>Wisdom and Folly</h4>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Dead flies putrefy the perfumer’s ointment,
        And cause it to give off a foul odor;
        So does a little folly to one respected for wisdom and honor.</p>
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>A wise man’s heart is at his right hand,
        But a fool’s heart at his left.
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Even when a fool walks along the way,
        He lacks wisdom,
        And he shows everyone that he is a fool.
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>If the spirit of the ruler rises against you,
        Do not leave your post;
        For conciliation pacifies great offenses.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>There is an evil I have seen under the sun,
        As an error proceeding from the ruler:
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Folly is set in great dignity,
        While the rich sit in a lowly place.
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>I have seen servants on horses,
        While princes walk on the ground like servants.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>He who digs a pit will fall into it,
        And whoever breaks through a wall will be bitten by a serpent.
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>He who quarries stones may be hurt by them,
        And he who splits wood may be endangered by it.
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>If the ax is dull,
        And one does not sharpen the edge,
        Then he must use more strength;
        But wisdom brings success.</p>



    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>A serpent may bite when it is not charmed;
The babbler is no different.
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious,
        But the lips of a fool shall swallow him up;
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>The words of his mouth begin with foolishness,
    And the end of his talk is raving madness.
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>A fool also multiplies words.
    No man knows what is to be;
    Who can tell him what will be after him?
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>The labor of fools wearies them,
    For they do not even know how to go to the city!</p>



    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child,
        And your princes feast in the morning!
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Blessed are you, O land, when your king is the son of nobles,
    And your princes feast at the proper time—
    For strength and not for drunkenness!
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Because of laziness the building decays,
    And through idleness of hands the house leaks.
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>A feast is made for laughter,
    And wine makes merry;
    But money answers everything.</p>

    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Do not curse the king, even in your thought;
        Do not curse the rich, even in your bedroom;
        For a bird of the air may carry your voice,
        And a bird in flight may tell the matter.</p>
