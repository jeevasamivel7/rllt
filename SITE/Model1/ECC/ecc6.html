<h2>Ecclesiastes 6</h2>


<h4>Wealth Is Not the Goal of Life</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men: 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>A man to whom God has given riches and wealth and honor, so that he lacks nothing for himself of all he desires; yet God does not give him power to eat of it, but a foreigner consumes it. This is vanity, and it is an evil affliction.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>If a man begets a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not satisfied with goodness, or indeed he has no burial, I say that a stillborn child is better than he"
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>for it comes in vanity and departs in darkness, and its name is covered with darkness.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Though it has not seen the sun or known anything, this has more rest than that man,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>even if he lives a thousand years twice' but has not seen goodness. Do not all go to one place?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>All the labor of man is for his mouth,And yet the soul is not satisfied.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>For what more has the wise man than the fool?What does the poor man have,Who knows how to walk before the living?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of desire.This also is vanity and grasping for the wind.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Whatever one is, he has been named already,For it is known that he is man;And he cannot contend with Him who is mightier than he.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Since there are many things that increase vanity,How is man the better?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>For who knows what is good for man in life, all the days of his vain life which he passes like a shadow? Who can tell a man what will happen after him under the sun?</p>
