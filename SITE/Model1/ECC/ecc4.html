<h2>Ecclesiastes 4</h2>


<h4>The Uselessness of Selfish Toil</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Then I returned and considered all the oppression that is done under the sun: And look! The tears of the oppressed,But they have no comforter 'On the side of their oppressors there is power,But they have no comforter.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Therefore I praised the dead who were already dead,More than the living who are still alive.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Yet, better than both is he who has never existed,
Who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</p>
<h4>The Vanity of Selfish Toil</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Again, I saw that for all toil and every skillful work a man is envied by his neighbor. This also is vanity and grasping for the wind.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>The fool folds his hands
And consumes his own flesh.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Better a handful with quietness Than both hands full, together with toil and grasping for the wind.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>There is one alone, without companion:He has neither son nor brother.Yet there is no end to all his labors,Nor is his eye satisfied with riches.
But he never asks,"For whom do I toil and deprive myself of good?"This also is vanity and a grave misfortune.</p>
<h4>The Value of a Friend</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Two are better than one,Because they have a good reward for their labor.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>For if they fall, one will lift up his companion.But woe to him who is alone when he falls,For he has no one to help him up.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Again, if two lie down together, they will keep warm;But how can one be warm alone?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Though one may be overpowered by another, two can withstand him. And a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</p>
<h4>Popularity Passes Away</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Better a poor and wise youth Than an old and foolish king who will be admonished no more.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>For he comes out of prison to be king,Although he was born poor in his kingdom.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>I saw all the living who walk under the sun;They were with the second youth who stands in his place.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>There was no end of all the people over whom he was made king; Yet those who come afterward will not rejoice in him.Surely this also is vanity and grasping for the wind.</p>
