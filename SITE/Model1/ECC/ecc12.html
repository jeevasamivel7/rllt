        <h2>Ecclesiastes 12</h2>
        <h4>Seek God in Early Life</h4>

    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Remember now your Creator in the days of your youth,
        Before the difficult days come,
        And the years draw near when you say,
        “I have no pleasure in them”:</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>While the sun and the light,
        The moon and the stars,
        Are not darkened,
        And the clouds do not return after the rain;</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>In the day when the keepers of the house tremble,
        And the strong men bow down;
        When the grinders cease because they are few,
        And those that look through the windows grow dim;</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>When the doors are shut in the streets,
        And the sound of grinding is low;
        When one rises up at the sound of a bird,
        And all the daughters of music are brought low.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Also they are afraid of height,
        And of terrors in the way;
        When the almond tree blossoms,
        The grasshopper is a burden,
        And desire fails.
        For man goes to his eternal home,
        And the mourners go about the streets.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Remember your Creator before the silver cord is loosed,
        Or the golden bowl is broken,
        Or the pitcher shattered at the fountain,
        Or the wheel broken at the well.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Then the dust will return to the earth as it was,
        And the spirit will return to God who gave it.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>“Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher,
        “All is vanity.”</p>

    <h4>The Whole Duty of Man</h4>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>And moreover, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yes, he pondered and sought out and set in order many proverbs.
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>The Preacher sought to find acceptable words; and what was written was upright—words of truth.
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>The words of the wise are like goads, and the words of scholars are like well-driven nails, given by one Shepherd.
    <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>And further, my son, be admonished by these. Of making many books there is no end, and much study is wearisome to the flesh.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter:
        Fear God and keep His commandments,
        For this is man’s all.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>For God will bring every work into judgment,
        Including every secret thing,
        Whether good or evil.</p>
