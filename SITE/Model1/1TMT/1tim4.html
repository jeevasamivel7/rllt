<h2>1Timothy 4</h2>


<h4>The Great Apostasy</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their own conscience seared with a hot iron, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be refused if it is received with thanksgiving; 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</p>
 <h4>A Good Servant of Jesus Christ</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>If you instruct the brethren in these things, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished in the words of faith and of the good doctrine which you have carefully followed.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>But reject profane and old wivesâ€™ fables, and exercise yourself toward godliness. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>For bodily exercise profits a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>These things command and teach.</p>
 <h4>Take Heed to Your Ministry</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Let no one despise your youth, but be an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Till I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the eldership. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Meditate on these things; give yourself entirely to them, that your progress may be evident to all. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine. Continue in them, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you.</p>
