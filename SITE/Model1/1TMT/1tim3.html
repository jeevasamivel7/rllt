<h2>1Timothy 4</h2>


<h4></h4>
The Great Apostasy
1Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons, 
2speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their own conscience seared with a hot iron, 
3forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
 4For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be refused if it is received with thanksgiving; 
5for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.

A Good Servant of Jesus Christ
6If you instruct the brethren in these things, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished in the words of faith and of the good doctrine which you have carefully followed. 
7But reject profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise yourself toward godliness. 
8For bodily exercise profits a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.
 9This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance. 
10For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe. 11These things command and teach.

Take Heed to Your Ministry
12Let no one [d]despise your youth, but be an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, [e]in spirit, in faith, in purity. 13Till I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to [f]doctrine. 14Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the eldership. 15Meditate on these things; give yourself entirely to them, that your progress may be evident to all. 16Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine. Continue in them, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you.
