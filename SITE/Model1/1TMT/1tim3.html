<h2>1Timothy 3</h2>


<h4>Qualifications of Overseers</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>This is a faithful saying: If a man desires the position of a bishop, he desires a good work.
  <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober-minded, of good behavior, hospitable, able to teach;
  <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>not [b]given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not covetous;
  <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>one who rules his own house well, having his children in submission with all reverence
  <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>(for if a man does not know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?); 
  <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>not a novice, lest being puffed up with pride he fall into the same condemnation as the devil.
  <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Moreover he must have a good testimony among those who are outside, lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</p>
  <h4>Qualifications of Deacons</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Likewise deacons must be reverent, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy for money,
  <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>holding the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience. 
  <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>But let these also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons, being found blameless.
  <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Likewise, their wives must be reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.
  <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Let deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well. 
  <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>For those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a good standing and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
  <h4>The Great Mystery</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>These things I write to you, though I hope to come to you shortly; 
  <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>but if I am delayed, I write so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and [h]ground of the truth. 
  <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness:God was manifested in the flesh,Justified in the Spirit,Seen by angels,Preached among the Gentiles,Believed on in the world,Received up in glory.</p>
