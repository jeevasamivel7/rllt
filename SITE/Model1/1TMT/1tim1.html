<h2>1Timothy 1</h2>


<h4>Greeting</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the commandment of God our Savior and the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>To Timothy, a true son in the faith:Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<h4>No Other Doctrine</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>As I urged you when I went into Macedoniaâ€”remain in Ephesus that you may charge some that they teach no other doctrine,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>nor give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which cause disputes rather than godly edification which is in faith. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Now the purpose of the commandment is love from a pure heart, from a good conscience, and from sincere faith,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>from which some, having strayed, have turned aside to idle talk, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say nor the things which they affirm.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>knowing this: that the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God which was committed to my trust.</p>
<h4>Glory to God for His Grace</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who has enabled me, because He counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry, </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>although I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an  insolent man; but I obtained mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant, with faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief. </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>However, for this reason I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show all longsuffering, as a pattern to those who are going to believe on Him for everlasting life. </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<h4>Fight the Good Fight</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may wage the good warfare, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>having faith and a good conscience, which some having rejected, concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme.</p>
