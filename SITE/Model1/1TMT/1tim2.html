<h2>1Timothy 2</h2>


<h4>Pray for All Men</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>for kings and all who are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and reverence. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>who gave Himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>or which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle"I am speaking the truth in Christ and not lying" a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</p>
<h4>Men and Women in the Church</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>I desire therefore that the men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting; 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>in like manner also, that the women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with propriety and moderation, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly clothing, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>but, which is proper for women professing godliness, with good works. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Let a woman learn in silence with all submission. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>And I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man, but to be in silence. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived, fell into transgression.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Nevertheless she will be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith, love, and holiness, with self-control.</p>
