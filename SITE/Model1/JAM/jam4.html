<h2>James4</h2>


<h4>Pride Promotes Strife</h4>




<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Where do wars and fights come from among you? Do they not come from your desires for pleasure that war in your members?
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-1.htm" target="_blank">2</a>You lust and do not have. You murder and covet and cannot obtain. You fight and war. Yet you do not have because you do not ask.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-1.htm" target="_blank">3</a>You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-1.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Adulterers and adulteresses! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-1.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, “The Spirit who dwells in us yearns jealously”?</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-1.htm" target="_blank">6</a>But He gives more grace. Therefore He says:“God resists the proud,But gives grace to the humble.”</p>



<h4>Humility Cures Worldliness</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-1.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-1.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-1.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Lament and mourn and weep! Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-1.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He will lift you up.</p>

<h4>Do Not Judge a Brother</h4>




<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-1.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Do not speak evil of one another, brethren. He who speaks evil of a brother and judges his brother, speaks evil of the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-1.htm" target="_blank">12</a>There is one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. Who are you to judge another?</p>



<h4>Do Not Boast About Tomorrow</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-1.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, spend a year there, buy and sell, and make a profit”;
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-1.htm" target="_blank">14</a>whereas you do not know what will happen tomorrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away.</p>
                                             
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-1.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Instead you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we shall live and do this or that.” </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-1.htm" target="_blank">16</a>16But now you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-1.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Therefore, to him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin.</p>
