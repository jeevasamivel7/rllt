<h4>Greeting to the Twelve Tribes</h4>
 

<h4>Profiting from Trials</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience.</p>
 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord;</p>

<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.</p>
                       
<h4>The Perspective of Rich and Poor</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Let the lowly brother glory in his exaltation, 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>10but the rich in his humiliation, because as a flower of the field he will pass away. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>For no sooner has the sun risen with a burning heat than it withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beautiful appearance perishes. So the rich man also will fade away in his pursuits.</p>

<h4>Loving God Under Trials</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am tempted by God”; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death.</p>




<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren. </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Of His own will He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.</p>

<h4>Qualities Needed in Trials</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>So then, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath; 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God.</p>



<h4>Doers—Not Hearers Only</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Therefore lay aside all filthiness and overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.</p>
 

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror;
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>If anyone among you thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this one’s religion is useless.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.</p>
