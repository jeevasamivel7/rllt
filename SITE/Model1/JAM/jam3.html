<h4>he Untamable Tongue</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>My brethren, let not many of you become teachers, knowing that we shall receive a stricter judgment.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>For we all stumble in many things. If anyone does not stumble in word, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle the whole body.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Indeed, we put bits in horsesâ€™ mouths that they may obey us, and we turn their whole body.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Look also at ships: although they are so large and are driven by fierce winds, they are turned by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Even so the tongue is a little member and boasts great things.See how great a forest a little fire kindles!</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. The tongue is so set among our members that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire by hell.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and creature of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by mankind. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>But no man can tame the tongue. It is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the similitude of God.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Out of the same mouth proceed blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be so.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Does a spring send forth fresh water and bitter from the same opening?
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Can a fig tree, my brethren, bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh.</p>


<h4>Heavenly Versus Demonic Wisdom
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by good conduct that his works are done in the meekness of wisdom.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>But if you have bitter envy and self-seeking in your hearts, do not boast and lie against the truth. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>This wisdom does not descend from above, but is earthly, sensual, demonic.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>For where envy and self-seeking exist, confusion and every evil thing are there.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.</p>
