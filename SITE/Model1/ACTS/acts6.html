<h2> Acts 6 </h2>


<h4>Seven Chosen to Serve</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a complaint against the Hebrews by the Hellenists, because their widows were neglected in the daily distribution. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Then the twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, “It is not desirable that we should leave the word of God and serve tables.                                                          
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Therefore, brethren, seek out from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business; 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”</p>                                                                    


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>And the saying pleased the whole multitude. And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>whom they set before the apostles; and when they had prayed, they laid hands on them.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Then the word of God spread, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were obedient to the faith.</p>

<h4>Stephen Accused of Blasphemy</h4>





<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and signs among the people.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Then there arose some from what is called the Synagogue of the Freedmen (Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia), disputing with Stephen.</p>
 </p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.</p>
 </p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Then they secretly induced men to say, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.”</p>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>And they stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes; and they came upon him, seized him, and brought him to the council. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>They also set up false witnesses who said, “This man does not cease to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law; </p>?
</p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs which Moses delivered to us.”
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>And all who sat in the council, looking steadfastly at him, saw his face as the face of an angel.</p>
