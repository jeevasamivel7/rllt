<h2> Acts 11 </h2>


<h4>Peter Defends God’s Grace</h4>
 
 



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Now the apostles and brethren who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision contended with him,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>saying, “You went in to uncircumcised men and ate with them!”</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>But Peter explained it to them in order from the beginning, saying:
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>“I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, an object descending like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came to me.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>When I observed it intently and considered, I saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air.
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>And I heard a voice saying to me,<a style="color:#770000;"> ‘Rise, Peter; kill and eat.’</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>But I said, ‘Not so, Lord! For nothing common or unclean has at any time entered my mouth.’
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>But the voice answered me again from heaven,<a style="color:#770000;"> ‘What God has cleansed you must not call common.’</a> </p>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Now this was done three times, and all were drawn up again into heaven.</p>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>At that very moment, three men stood before the house where I was, having been sent to me from Caesarea.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Then the Spirit told me to go with them, doubting nothing. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered the man’s house.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>And he told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house, who said to him, ‘Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon whose surname is Peter,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>who will tell you words by which you and all your household will be saved.’ 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, as upon us at the beginning.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said,<a style="color:#770000;"> ‘John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>If therefore God gave them the same gift as He gave us when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could withstand God?”</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>When they heard these things they became silent; and they glorified God, saying, “Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life.”</p>

<h4>Barnabas and Saul at Antioch</h4>




<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Now those who were scattered after the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to no one but the Jews only. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, preaching the Lord Jesus.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.</p>




<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Then news of these things came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>When he came and had seen the grace of God, he was glad, and encouraged them all that with purpose of heart they should continue with the Lord.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>For he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were added to the Lord.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Then Barnabas departed for Tarsus to seek Saul.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. So it was that for a whole year they assembled with the church and taught a great many people. And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.</p>

<h4>Relief to Judea</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>And in these days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>Then one of them, named Agabus, stood up and showed by the Spirit that there was going to be a great famine throughout all the world, which also happened in the days of Claudius Caesar.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>Then the disciples, each according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brethren dwelling in Judea.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>This they also did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.</p>
