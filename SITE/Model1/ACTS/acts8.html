<h2> Acts 8 </h2>


<h4>Saul Persecutes the Church</h4>







<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Now Saul was consenting to his death.At that time a great persecution arose against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.</p>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering every house, and dragging off men and women, committing them to prison.</p>



<h4>Christ Is Preached in Samaria</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Therefore those who were scattered went everywhere preaching the word. </p>
 <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ to them. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>And the multitudes with one accord heeded the things spoken by Philip, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>For unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, came out of many who were possessed; and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>And there was great joy in that city.</p>



<h4>The Sorcerer’s Profession of Faith</h4>




<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>But there was a certain man called Simon, who previously practiced sorcery in the city and astonished the  people of Samaria, claiming that he was someone great,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, “This man is the great power of God.” 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>And they heeded him because he had astonished them with his sorceries for a long time.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>But when they believed Philip as he preached the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were baptized.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Then Simon himself also believed; and when he was baptized he continued with Philip, and was amazed, seeing the miracles and signs which were done .</p>




<h4>The Sorcerer’s Sin</h4>






<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>who, when they had come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>For as yet He had fallen upon none of them. They had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Then they laid hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</p>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>And when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>saying, “Give me this power also, that anyone on whom I lay hands may receive the Holy Spirit.”</p>




<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>But Peter said to him, “Your money perish with you, because you thought that the gift of God could be purchased with money!</p> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>You have neither part nor portion in this matter, for your heart is not right in the sight of God.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Repent therefore of this your wickedness, and pray God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>For I see that you are poisoned by bitterness and bound by iniquity.”</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>Then Simon answered and said, “Pray to the Lord for me, that none of the things which you have spoken may come upon me.”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>So when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</p>


<h4>Christ Is Preached to an Ethiopian</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, “Arise and go toward the south along the road which goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” This is desert.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>So he arose and went. And behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge of all her treasury, and had come to Jerusalem to worship, 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>was returning. And sitting in his chariot, he was reading Isaiah the prophet. </p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>Then the Spirit said to Philip, “Go near and overtake this chariot.”</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, “Do you understand what you are reading?”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>And he said, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” And he asked Philip to come up and sit with him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>The place in the Scripture which he read was this:“He was led as a sheep to the slaughter;And as a lamb before its shearer is silent,So He opened not His mouth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>In His humiliation His justice was taken away,And who will declare His generation?For His life is taken from the earth.”</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>So the eunuch answered Philip and said, “I ask you, of whom does the prophet say this, of himself or of some other man?” 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a>Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning at this Scripture, preached Jesus to him.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-36.htm" target="_blank">36</a>Now as they went down the road, they came to some water. And the eunuch said, “See, here is water. What hinders me from being baptized?”</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-37.htm" target="_blank">37</a>Then Philip said, “If you believe with all your heart, you may.”And he answered and said, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-38.htm" target="_blank">38</a>So he commanded the chariot to stand still. And both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he baptized him. </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-39.htm" target="_blank">39</a>Now when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, so that the eunuch saw him no more; and he went on his way rejoicing. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-40.htm" target="_blank">40</a></p>But Philip was found at Azotus. And passing through, he preached in all the cities till he came to Caesarea.</p>
