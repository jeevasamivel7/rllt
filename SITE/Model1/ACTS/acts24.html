<h2> Acts 24 </h2>


<h4>Accused of Sedition</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Now after five days Ananias the high priest came down with the elders and a certain orator named Tertullus. These gave evidence to the governor against Paul.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>And when he was called upon, Tertullus began his accusation, saying: “Seeing that through you we enjoy great peace, and prosperity is being brought to this nation by your foresight, 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>we accept it always and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.                                                                                                                
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Nevertheless, not to be tedious to you any further, I beg you to hear, by your courtesy, a few words from us. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>For we have found this man a plague, a creator of dissension among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>He even tried to profane the temple, and we seized him, and wanted to judge him according to our law.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>But the commander Lysias came by and with great violence took him out of our hands,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>commanding his accusers to come to you. By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him.” 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>And the Jews also assented, maintaining that these things were so.</p>



<h4>The Defense Before Felix</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Then Paul, after the governor had nodded to him to speak, answered: “Inasmuch as I know that you have been for many years a judge of this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>because you may ascertain that it is no more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>And they neither found me in the temple disputing with anyone nor inciting the crowd, either in the synagogues or in the city. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>But this I confess to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect, so I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and in the Prophets.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>I have hope in God, which they themselves also accept, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and the unjust.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>This being so, I myself always strive to have a conscience without offense toward God and men.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>“Now after many years I came to bring alms and offerings to my nation,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>in the midst of which some Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with a mob nor with tumult.</p>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>They ought to have been here before you to object if they had anything against me.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Or else let those who are here themselves say if they found any wrongdoing in me while I stood before the council, 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>unless it is for this one statement which I cried out, standing among them, ‘Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged by you this day.’ ”</p>

<h4>Felix Procrastinates</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>But when Felix heard these things, having more accurate knowledge of the Way, he adjourned the proceedings and said, “When Lysias the commander comes down, I will make a decision on your case.”</p>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>So he commanded the centurion to keep Paul and to let him have liberty, and told him not to forbid any of his friends to provide for or visit him.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>And after some days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Now as he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and answered, “Go away for now; when I have a convenient time I will call for you.” </p>
 <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>Meanwhile he also hoped that money would be given him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore he sent for him more often and conversed with him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>But after two years Porcius Festus succeeded Felix; and Felix, wanting to do the Jews a favor, left Paul bound.</p>
