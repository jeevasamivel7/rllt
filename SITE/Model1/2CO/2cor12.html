<h2>2Corinthians 12  </h2>
<h4>  The Vision of Paradise </h4> 
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord: 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago—whether in the body I do not know, or whether out of the body I do not know, God knows—such a one was caught up to the third heaven. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>And I know such a man—whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows— 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>how he was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Of such a one I will boast; yet of myself I will not boast, except in my infirmities. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>For though I might desire to boast, I will not be a fool; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, lest anyone should think of me above what he sees me to be or hears from me.</p>
<h4>  The Thorn in the Flesh </h4>  
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>And lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I be exalted above measure. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Concerning this thing I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>And He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.</p>
<h4> Signs of an Apostle  </h4>  
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>I have become a fool in boasting; you have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you; for in nothing was I behind the most eminent apostles, though I am nothing. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Truly the signs of an apostle were accomplished among you with all perseverance, in signs and wonders and mighty deeds. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>For what is it in which you were inferior to other churches, except that I myself was not burdensome to you? Forgive me this wrong!</p>
<h4> Love for the Church  </h4>  
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Now for the third time I am ready to come to you. And I will not be burdensome to you; for I do not seek yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>And I will very gladly spend and be spent for your souls; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>But be that as it may, I did not burden you. Nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you by cunning! 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Did I take advantage of you by any of those whom I sent to you? 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>I urged Titus, and sent our brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Again, do you think that we excuse ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ. But we do all things, beloved, for your edification. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>For I fear lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I wish, and that I shall be found by you such as you do not wish; lest there be contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, backbitings, whisperings, conceits, tumults;
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and I shall mourn for many who have sinned before and have not repented of the uncleanness, fornication, and lewdness which they have practiced.</p>
