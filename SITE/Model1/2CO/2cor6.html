<h2>2Corinthians 6  </h2>
<h4> Marks of the Ministry  </h4> 

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a></pWe then, as workers together with Him also plead with you not to receive the grace of God in vain.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>For He says:“In an acceptable time I have heard you,And in the day of salvation I have helped you.”Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>We give no offense in anything, that our ministry may not be blamed. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>But in all things we commend ourselves as ministers of God: in much patience, in tribulations, in needs, in distresses, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in fastings; 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>by purity, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by sincere love, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true; 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold we live; as chastened, and yet not killed; 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>10as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.</p>
<h4> Be Holy  </h4>  
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>O Corinthians! We have spoken openly to you, our heart is wide open.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Now in return for the same (I speak as to children), you also be open.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness? 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>And what accord has Christ with Belial? Or what part has a believer with an unbeliever? 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God. As God has said:“I will dwell in them And walk among them.I will be their God,And they shall be My people.”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Therefore “Come out from among them And be separate, says the Lord.Do not touch what is unclean,And I will receive you.”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>“I will be a Father to you,And you shall be My sons and daughters,Says the Lord Almighty.”</p>
