<h2> Proverbs 31 </h2>

<h4> The Words of King Lemuel's Mother  </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-1.htm." target="_blank">1</a>The words of King Lemuel, the utterance which his mother taught him:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-2.htm." target="_blank">2</a>What, my son? And what, son of my womb?And what, son of my vows?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-3.htm." target="_blank">3</a>Do not give your strength to women,Nor your ways to that which destroys kings.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-4.htm." target="_blank">4</a>It is not for kings, O Lemuel,It is not for kings to drink wine,Nor for princes intoxicating drink;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-5.htm." target="_blank">5</a>Lest they drink and forget the law,And pervert the justice of all the afflicted.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-6.htm." target="_blank">6</a>Give strong drink to him who is perishing,And wine to those who are bitter of heart.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-7.htm." target="_blank">7</a>Let him drink and forget his poverty,And remember his misery no more.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-8.htm." target="_blank">8</a>Open your mouth for the speechless,In the cause of all who are appointed to die.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-9.htm." target="_blank">9</a>Open your mouth, judge righteously,And plead the cause of the poor and needy.</p>
<h4>  The Virtuous Wife </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-10.htm." target="_blank">10</a>Who can find a virtuous wife?For her worth is far above rubies.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-11.htm." target="_blank">11</a>The heart of her husband safely trusts her;So he will have no lack of gain.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-12.htm." target="_blank">12</a>She does him good and not evil All the days of her life.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-13.htm." target="_blank">13</a>She seeks wool and flax,And willingly works with her hands.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-14.htm." target="_blank">14</a>She is like the merchant ships,She brings her food from afar.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-15.htm." target="_blank">15</a>She also rises while it is yet night,And provides food for her household,And a portion for her maidservants.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-16.htm." target="_blank">16</a>She considers a field and buys it;From her profits she plants a vineyard.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-17.htm." target="_blank">17</a>She girds herself with strength,And strengthens her arms.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-18.htm." target="_blank">18</a>She perceives that her merchandise is good,And her lamp does not go out by night.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-19.htm." target="_blank">19</a>She stretches out her hands to the distaff,And her hand holds the spindle.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-20.htm." target="_blank">20</a>She extends her hand to the poor,Yes, she reaches out her hands to the needy.</p>
 <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-22.htm." target="_blank">22</a>She makes tapestry for herself;Her clothing is fine linen and purple.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-23.htm." target="_blank">23</a>Her husband is known in the gates,When he sits among the elders of the land.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-24.htm." target="_blank">24</a>She makes linen garments and sells them,And supplies sashes for the merchants.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-25.htm." target="_blank">25</a>Strength and honor are her clothing;She shall rejoice in time to come.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-26.htm." target="_blank">26</a>She opens her mouth with wisdom,And on her tongue is the law of kindness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-27.htm." target="_blank">27</a>She watches over the ways of her household,And does not eat the bread of idleness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-28.htm." target="_blank">28</a>Her children rise up and call her blessed;Her husband also, and he praises her:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-29.htm." target="_blank">29</a>'Many daughters have done well,But you excel them all.'</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-30.htm." target="_blank">30</a>Charm is deceitful and beauty is passing,But a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-31.htm." target="_blank">31</a>Give her of the fruit of her hands,And let her own works praise her in the gates.</p>
