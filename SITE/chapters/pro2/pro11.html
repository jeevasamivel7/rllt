    <h2> Proverbs 11 </h2>
    
    <h4>The Folly of Wickedness</h4>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-1.htm" target="-blank">1</a>Dishonest scales are an abomination to the Lord,
        But a just weight is His delight.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-2.htm" target="-blank">2</a>When pride comes, then comes shame;
        But with the humble is wisdom.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-3.htm" target="-blank">3</a>The integrity of the upright will guide them,
        But the perversity of the unfaithful will destroy them.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-4.htm" target="-blank">4</a>Riches do not profit in the day of wrath,
        But righteousness delivers from death.</p> 
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-5.htm" target="-blank">5</a>The righteousness of the blameless will direct his way aright,
        But the wicked will fall by his own wickedness.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-6.htm" target="-blank">6</a>The righteousness of the upright will deliver them,
        But the unfaithful will be caught by their lust.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-7.htm" target="-blank">7</a>When a wicked man dies, his expectation will perish,
        And the hope of the unjust perishes.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-8.htm" target="-blank">8</a>The righteous is delivered from trouble,
        And it comes to the wicked instead.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-9.htm" target="-blank">9</a>The hypocrite with his mouth destroys his neighbor,
        But through knowledge the righteous will be delivered.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-10.htm" target="-blank">10</a>When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices;
        And when the wicked perish, there is jubilation.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-11.htm" target="-blank">11</a>By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted,
        But it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-12.htm" target="-blank">12</a>He who is devoid of wisdom despises his neighbor,
        But a man of understanding holds his peace.  </p>

    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-13.htm" target="-blank">13</a>A talebearer reveals secrets,
        But he who is of a faithful spirit conceals a matter.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-14.htm" target="-blank">14</a>Where there is no counsel, the people fall;
        But in the multitude of counselors there is safety.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-15.htm" target="-blank">15</a>He who is surety for a stranger will suffer,
        But one who hates being surety is secure.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-16.htm" target="-blank">16</a>A gracious woman retains honor,
        But ruthless men retain riches.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-17.htm" target="-blank">17</a>The merciful man does good for his own soul,
        But he who is cruel troubles his own flesh.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-18.htm" target="-blank">18</a>The wicked man does deceptive work,
        But he who sows righteousness will have a sure reward.</p>
     <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-19.htm" target="-blank">19</a>As righteousness leads to life,
            So he who pursues evil pursues it to his own death.</p>
     <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-20.htm" target="-blank">20</a>Those who are of a perverse heart are an abomination to the Lord,
        But the blameless in their ways are His delight.</p>
     <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-21.htm" target="-blank">21</a>Though they join forces, the wicked will not go unpunished;
        But the posterity of the righteous will be delivered.</p>
   <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-22.htm" target="-blank">22</a>As a ring of gold in a swineâ€™s snout,
    So is a lovely woman who lacks discretion.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-23.htm" target="-blank">23</a>The desire of the righteous is only good,
        But the expectation of the wicked is wrath.</p>
     <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-24.htm" target="-blank">24</a>There is one who scatters, yet increases more;
        And there is one who withholds more than is right,
        But it leads to poverty.</p>
     <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-25.htm" target="-blank">25</a>The generous soul will be made rich,
        And he who waters will also be watered himself.</p>
     <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-26.htm" target="-blank">26</a>The people will curse him who withholds grain,
        But blessing will be on the head of him who sells it.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-27.htm" target="-blank">27</a>He who earnestly seeks good finds favor,
        But trouble will come to him who seeks evil.
        </p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-28.htm" target="-blank">28</a>He who trusts in his riches will fall,
        But the righteous will flourish like foliage.
        </p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-29.htm" target="-blank">29</a>He who troubles his own house will inherit the wind,
        And the fool will be servant to the wise of heart.
        </p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-30.htm" target="-blank">30</a>The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life,
And he who wins souls is wise.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-31.htm" target="-blank">31</a>The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom,
                    But the perverse tongue will be cut out.</p>
