<h2> proverbs 23 </h2>



<h4>Listen to Your Father</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>When you sit down to eat with a ruler,Consider carefully what is before you;</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>And put a knife to your throatIf you are a man given to appetite.</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Do not desire his delicacies,For they are deceptive food.</P>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Do not overwork to be rich;Because of your own understanding, cease!</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Will you set your eyes on that which is not?For riches certainly make themselves wings;They fly away like an eagle toward heaven.</P>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Do not eat the bread of a miser,Nor desire his delicacies;</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>For as he thinks in his heart, so is he.�Eat and drink!� he says to you,But his heart is not with you.</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>The morsel you have eaten, you will vomit up,And waste your pleasant words.</P>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Do not speak in the hearing of a fool,For he will despise the wisdom of your words.</P>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Do not remove the ancient landmark,Nor enter the fields of the fatherless;</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>For their Redeemer is mighty;He will plead their cause against you</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Apply your heart to instruction,And your ears to words of knowledge.</P>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Do not withhold correction from a child,For if you beat him with a rod, he will not die.</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>You shall beat him with a rod,And deliver his soul from hell.</P>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>My son, if your heart is wise,My heart will rejoice�indeed, I myself;</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Yes, my inmost being will rejoiceWhen your lips speak right things.</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Do not let your heart envy sinners,But be zealous for the fear of the Lord all the day;</P>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>For surely there is a hereafter,And your hope will not be cut off.</P>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Hear, my son, and be wise;And guide your heart in the way.</P>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Do not mix with winebibbers,Or with gluttonous eaters of meat;</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>For the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty,And drowsiness will clothe a man with rags.</P>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Listen to your father who begot you,And do not despise your mother when she is old.</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Buy the truth, and do not sell it,Also wisdom and instruction and understanding.</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice,And he who begets a wise child will delight in him.</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Let your father and your mother be glad,And let her who bore you rejoice.</P>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>My son, give me your heart,And let your eyes observe my ways.</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>For a harlot is a deep pit,And a seductress is a narrow well.</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>She also lies in wait as for a victim,And increases the unfaithful among men.</P>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>Who has woe?Who has sorrow?Who has contentions?Who has complaints?Who has wounds without cause?Who has redness of eyes?</P>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>Those who linger long at the wine,Those who go in search of mixed wine.</P>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>Do not look on the wine when it is red,When it sparkles in the cup,When it swirls around smoothly;</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>At the last it bites like a serpent,And stings like a viper.</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>Your eyes will see strange things,And your heart will utter perverse things.</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>Yes, you will be like one who lies down in the [h]midst of the sea,Or like one who lies at the top of the mast, saying:</P>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a>�They have struck me, but I was not hurt;They have beaten me, but I did not feel it.When shall I awake, that I may seek another drink?�</P>
