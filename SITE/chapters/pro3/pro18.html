<h2> proverbs 18 </h2>



<h4>The Name of the Lord Is a Strong Tower</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>A fool has no delight in understanding,But in expressing his own heart.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>When the wicked comes, contempt comes also;And with dishonor comes reproach.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>The words of a man's mouth are deep waters;The wellspring of wisdom is a flowing brook.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>The words of a talebearer are like tasty trifles,And they go down into the inmost body.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>He who is slothful in his workIs a brother to him who is a great destroyer.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>The name of the Lord is a strong tower;The righteous run to it and are safe.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>The rich man's wealth is his strong city,And like a high wall in his own esteem.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Before destruction the heart of a man is haughty,And before honor is humility.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>He who answers a matter before he hears it,It is folly and shame to him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>The spirit of a man will sustain him in sickness,But who can bear a broken spirit?</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18.htm" target="_blank">15</a>The heart of the prudent acquires knowledge,And the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>A man's gift makes room for him,And brings him before great men.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>The first one to plead his cause seems right,Until his neighbor comes and examines him.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Casting lots causes contentions to cease,And keeps the mighty apart.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>9A brother offended is harder to win than a strong city,And contentions are like the bars of a castle.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Death and life are in the power of the tongue,And those who love it will eat its fruit.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>He who finds a wife finds a good thing,And obtains favor from the Lord.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>The poor man uses entreaties,But the rich answers roughly.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>A man who has friends must himself be friendly,But there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.</p>
