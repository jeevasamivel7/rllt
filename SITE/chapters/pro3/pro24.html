<h2> proverbs 24 </h2>



<h4>Do Not Envy Evil Men</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Do not be envious of evil men,Nor desire to be with them;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>For their heart devises violence,And their lips talk of troublemaking.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Through wisdom a house is built,And by understanding it is established;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>By knowledge the rooms are filledWith all precious and pleasant riches.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>A wise man is strong,Yes, a man of knowledge increases strength;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>For by wise counsel you will wage your own war,And in a multitude of counselors there is safety.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Wisdom is too lofty for a fool;He does not open his mouth in the gate.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>He who plots to do evilWill be called a schemer.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>The devising of foolishness is sin,And the scoffer is an abomination to men.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>If you faint in the day of adversity,Your strength is small.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Deliver those who are drawn toward death,And hold back those stumbling to the slaughter.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>If you say, �Surely we did not know this,�Does not He who weighs the hearts consider it?He who keeps your soul, does He not know it?And will He not render to each man according to his deeds?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2413.htm" target="_blank">13</a>My son, eat honey because it is good,And the honeycomb which is sweet to your taste;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>So shall the knowledge of wisdom be to your soul;If you have found it, there is a prospect,And your hope will not be cut off.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Do not lie in wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous;Do not plunder his resting place;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>For a righteous man may fall seven timesAnd rise again,But the wicked shall fall by calamity.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Do not rejoice when your enemy falls,And do not let your heart be glad when he stumbles;</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Lest the Lord see it, and it displease Him,And He turn away His wrath from him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Do not fret because of evildoers,Nor be envious of the wicked;</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>For there will be no prospect for the evil man;The lamp of the wicked will be put out.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>My son, fear the Lord and the king;Do not associate with those given to change;</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>For their calamity will rise suddenly,And who knows the ruin those two can bring?Further Sayings of the Wise</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>These things also belong to the wise:It is not good to show partiality in judgment.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>He who says to the wicked, �You are righteous,�Him the people will curse;Nations will abhor him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>But those who rebuke the wicked will have delight,And a good blessing will come upon them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>He who gives a right answer kisses the lips.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>Prepare your outside work,Make it fit for yourself in the field;And afterward build your house.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause,For would you deceive with your lips?</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>Do not say, �I will do to him just as he has done to me;I will render to the man according to his work.�</p>






<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>I went by the field of the lazy man,And by the vineyard of the man devoid of understanding;

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>And there it was, all overgrown with thorns;Its surface was covered with nettles;Its stone wall was broken down.
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>When I saw it, I considered it well;I looked on it and received instruction:
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>A little sleep, a little slumber,A little folding of the hands to rest;
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>So shall your poverty come like a prowler,And your need like an armed man.
