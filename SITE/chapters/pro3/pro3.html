<h2> Proverbs 3 </h2>

<h4>Guidance for the Young</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-1.htm">1</a>My son, do not forget my law,
But let your heart keep my commands;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-2.htm">2</a>For length of days and long life
And peace they will add to you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-3.htm">3</a>Let not mercy and truth forsake you;
Bind them around your neck,
Write them on the tablet of your heart,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-4.htm">4</a>And so find favor and high esteem
In the sight of God and man.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-Trust in the Lord with all your heart,
And lean not on your own understanding;
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-6.htm">6</a>In all your ways acknowledge Him,
And He shall direct your paths.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-7.htm">7</a>Do not be wise in your own eyes;
Fear the Lord and depart from evil.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-8.htm">8</a>It will be health to your flesh,
And strength to your bones.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-9.htm">9</a>Honor the Lord with your possessions,
And with the firstfruits of all your increase;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-10.htm">10</a>So your barns will be filled with plenty,
And your vats will overflow with new wine.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-11.htm">11</a>My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord,
Nor detest His correction;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-12.htm">12</a>For whom the Lord loves He corrects,
Just as a father the son in whom he delights.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-13.htm">13</a>Happy is the man who finds wisdom,
And the man who gains understanding;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-14.htm">14</a>For her proceeds are better than the profits of silver,
And her gain than fine gold.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-15.htm">15</a>She is more precious than rubies,
And all the things you may desire cannot compare with her.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-16.htm">16</a>Length of days is in her right hand,
In her left hand riches and honor.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-17.htm">17</a>Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
And all her paths are peace.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-18.htm">18</a>She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her,
And happy are all who retain her.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-19.htm">19</a>The Lord by wisdom founded the earth;
By understanding He established the heavens;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-20.htm">20</a>By His knowledge the depths were broken up,
And clouds drop down the dew.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-21.htm">21</a>My son, let them not depart from your eyes;
Keep sound wisdom and discretion;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-22.htm">22</a>So they will be life to your soul
And grace to your neck.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-23.htm">23</a>Then you will walk safely in your way,
And your foot will not stumble.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-24.htm">24</a>When you lie down, you will not be afraid;
Yes, you will lie down and your sleep will be sweet.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-25.htm">25</a>Do not be afraid of sudden terror,
Nor of trouble from the wicked when it comes;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-26.htm">26</a>For the Lord will be your confidence,
And will keep your foot from being caught.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-27.htm">27</a>Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due,
When it is in the power of your hand to do so.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-28.htm">28</a>Do not say to your neighbor,
Go, and come back,
And tomorrow I will give it,
When you have it with you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-29.htm">29</a>Do not devise evil against your neighbor,
For he dwells by you for safety's sake.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-30.htm">30</a>Do not strive with a man without cause,
If he has done you no harm.
</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-31.htm">31</a>Do not envy the oppressor,
And choose none of his ways;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-32.htm">32</a>For the perverse person is an abomination to the Lord,
But His secret counsel is with the upright.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-33.htm">33</a>The curse of the Lord is on the house of the wicked,
But He blesses the home of the just.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-34.htm">34</a>Surely He scorns the scornful,
But gives grace to the humble.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-35.htm">35</a>The wise shall inherit glory,
But shame shall be the legacy of fools.
