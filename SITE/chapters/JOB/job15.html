<h2> Job 15 </h2>


<h4>Eliphaz Accuses Job of Folly</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>“Should a wise man answer with empty knowledge,And fill himself with the east wind?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Should he reason with unprofitable talk,Or by speeches with which he can do no good?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Yes, you cast off fear,And restrain prayer before God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>For your iniquity teaches your mouth,And you choose the tongue of the crafty.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Your own mouth condemns you, and not I;Yes, your own lips testify against you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>“Are you the first man who was born?Or were you made before the hills?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Have you heard the counsel of God?Do you limit wisdom to yourself?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>What do you know that we do not know?What do you understand that is not in us?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us,Much older than your father.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Are the consolations of God too small for you,And the word spoken gently with you?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Why does your heart carry you away,And what do your eyes wink at,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>That you turn your spirit against God,And let such words go out of your mouth?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>“What is man, that he could be pure?And he who is born of a woman, that he could be righteous?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>If God puts no trust in His saints,And the heavens are not pure in His sight,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>How much less man, who is abominable and filthy,Who drinks iniquity like water!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>“I will tell you, hear me;What I have seen I will declare,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>What wise men have told,Not hiding anything received from their fathers,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>To whom alone the land was given,And no alien passed among them:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>The wicked man writhes with pain all his days,And the number of years is hidden from the oppressor.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Dreadful sounds are in his ears;In prosperity the destroyer comes upon him.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>He does not believe that he will return from darkness,For a sword is waiting for him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>He wanders about for bread, saying, ‘Where is it?’He knows that a day of darkness is ready at his hand.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>Trouble and anguish make him afraid;They overpower him, like a king ready for battle.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>For he stretches out his hand against God,And acts defiantly against the Almighty,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>Running stubbornly against HimWith his strong, embossed shield.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>Though he has covered his face with his fatness,And made his waist heavy with fat,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>He dwells in desolate cities,In houses which no one inhabits,Which are destined to become ruins.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>He will not be rich,Nor will his wealth continue,Nor will his possessions overspread the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>He will not depart from darkness;The flame will dry out his branches,And by the breath of His mouth he will go away.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>Let him not trust in futile things, deceiving himself,For futility will be his reward.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>It will be accomplished before his time,And his branch will not be green.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>He will shake off his unripe grape like a vine,And cast off his blossom like an olive tree.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>For the company of hypocrites will be barren,And fire will consume the tents of bribery.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a>They conceive trouble and bring forth futility;Their womb prepares deceit.”</p>
