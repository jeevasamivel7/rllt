<h2> Proverbs 17</h2>



<h4>The Lord Tests Hearts</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Better is a dry morsel with quietness,Than a house full of feasting with strife.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>A wise servant will rule over a son who causes shame,And will share an inheritance among the brothers.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold,But the Lord tests the hearts.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>An evildoer gives heed to false lips;A liar listens eagerly to a spiteful tongue.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>He who mocks the poor reproaches his Maker;He who is glad at calamity will not go unpunished.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Children's children are the crown of old men,And the glory of children is their father.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Excellent speech is not becoming to a fool,Much less lying lips to a prince.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>A present is a precious stone in the eyes of its possessor;Wherever he turns, he prospers.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>He who covers a transgression seeks love,But he who repeats a matter separates friends.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Rebuke is more effective for a wise manThan a hundred blows on a fool.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>An evil man seeks only rebellion;Therefore a cruel messenger will be sent against him.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Let a man meet a bear robbed of her cubs,Rather than a fool in his folly.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Whoever rewards evil for good,Evil will not depart from his house.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>The beginning of strife is like releasing water;Therefore stop contention before a quarrel starts.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the just,Both of them alike are an abomination to the Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Why is there in the hand of a fool the purchase price of wisdom,Since he has no heart for it?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>A friend loves at all times,And a brother is born for adversity.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>A man devoid of understanding shakes hands in a pledge,And becomes surety for his friend.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>He who loves transgression loves strife,And he who exalts his gate seeks destruction.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>He who has a deceitful heart finds no good,And he who has a perverse tongue falls into evil.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>He who begets a scoffer does so to his sorrow,And the father of a fool has no joy.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>A merry heart does good, like medicine,But a broken spirit dries the bones.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>A wicked man accepts a bribe behind the backTo pervert the ways of justice.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>Wisdom is in the sight of him who has understanding,But the eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>A foolish son is a grief to his father,And bitterness to her who bore him.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>Also, to punish the righteous is not good,Nor to strike princes for their uprightness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>He who has knowledge spares his words,And a man of understanding is of a calm spirit.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>Even a fool is counted wise when he holds his peace;When he shuts his lips, he is considered perceptive.</p>
