<h2> PROVERBS 4 </h2>

<h4>Security in Wisdom</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-1.htm">1</a>Hear, my children, the instruction of a father,
And give attention to know understanding;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-2.htm">2</a>For I give you good doctrine:
Do not forsake my law.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-3.htm">3</a>When I was my father's son,
Tender and the only one in the sight of my mother,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-4.htm">4</a>He also taught me, and said to me:
Let your heart retain my words;
Keep my commands, and live.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-5.htm">5</a>Get wisdom! Get understanding!
Do not forget, nor turn away from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-6.htm">6</a>Do not forsake her, and she will preserve you;
Love her, and she will keep you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-7.htm">7</a>Wisdom is the principal thing;
Therefore get wisdom.
And in all your getting, get understanding.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-8.htm">8</a>Exalt her, and she will promote you;
She will bring you honor, when you embrace her.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-9.htm">9</a>She will place on your head an ornament of grace;
A crown of glory she will deliver to you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-10.htm">10</a>Hear, my son, and receive my sayings,
And the years of your life will be many.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-11.htm">11</a>I have taught you in the way of wisdom;
I have led you in right paths.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-12.htm">12</a>When you walk, your steps will not be hindered,
And when you run, you will not stumble.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-13.htm">13</a>Take firm hold of instruction, do not let go;
Keep her, for she is your life.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-14.htm">14</a>Do not enter the path of the wicked,
And do not walk in the way of evil.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-15.htm">15</a>Avoid it, do not travel on it;
Turn away from it and pass on.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-16.htm">16</a>For they do not sleep unless they have done evil;
And their sleep is taken away unless they make someone fall.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-17.htm">17</a>For they eat the bread of wickedness,
And drink the wine of violence.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-18.htm">18</a>But the path of the just is like the shining sun,
That shines ever brighter unto the perfect day.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-19.htm">19</a>The way of the wicked is like darkness;
They do not know what makes them stumble.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-20.htm">20</a>My son, give attention to my words;
Incline your ear to my sayings.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-21.htm">21</a>Do not let them depart from your eyes;
Keep them in the midst of your heart;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-22.htm">22</a>For they are life to those who find them,
And health to all their flesh.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-23.htm">23</a>Keep your heart with all diligence,
For out of it spring the issues of life.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-24.htm">24</a>Put away from you a deceitful mouth,
And put perverse lips far from you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-25.htm">25</a>Let your eyes look straight ahead,
And your eyelids look right before you</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-26.htm">26</a>Ponder the path of your feet,
And let all your ways be established.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-27.htm">27</a>Do not turn to the right or the left;
Remove your foot from evil.</p>
