<h2> Proverbs 28 </h2>

<h4>The Righteous Are Bold as a Lion   </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-1.htm." target="_blank">1</a>The wicked flee when no one pursues,But the righteous are bold as a lion.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-2.htm." target="_blank">2</a>Because of the transgression of a land, many are its princes;But by a man of understanding and knowledge Right will be prolonged.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-3.htm." target="_blank">3</a>A poor man who oppresses the poor Is like a driving rain which leaves no food.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-4.htm." target="_blank">4</a>Those who forsake the law praise the wicked,But such as keep the law contend with them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-5.htm." target="_blank">5</a>Evil men do not understand justice,But those who seek the Lord understand all.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-6.htm." target="_blank">6</a>Better is the poor who walks in his integrity Than one perverse in his ways, though he be rich.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-7.htm." target="_blank">7</a>Whoever keeps the law is a discerning son,But a companion of gluttons shames his father.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-8.htm." target="_blank">8</a>One who increases his possessions by usury and extortion Gathers it for him who will pity the poor.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-9.htm." target="_blank">9</a>One who turns away his ear from hearing the law,Even his prayer is an abomination.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-10.htm." target="_blank">10</a>Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way,He himself will fall into his own pit;But the blameless will inherit good.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-11.htm." target="_blank">11</a>The rich man is wise in his own eyes,But the poor who has understanding searches him out.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-12.htm." target="_blank">12</a>When the righteous rejoice, there is great glory;But when the wicked arise, men hide themselves.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-13.htm." target="_blank">13</a>He who covers his sins will not prosper,But whoever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-14.htm." target="_blank">14</a>Happy is the man who is always reverent,But he who hardens his heart will fall into calamity.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-15.htm." target="_blank">15</a>Like a roaring lion and a charging bear Is a wicked ruler over poor people.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-16.htm." target="_blank">16</a>A ruler who lacks understanding is a great oppressor,But he who hates covetousness will prolong his days.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-17.htm." target="_blank">17</a>A man burdened with bloodshed will flee into a pit;Let no one help him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-18.htm." target="_blank">18</a>Whoever walks blamelessly will be saved,But he who is perverse in his ways will suddenly fall.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-19.htm." target="_blank">19</a>He who tills his land will have plenty of bread,But he who follows frivolity will have poverty enough!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-20.htm." target="_blank">20</a>A faithful man will abound with blessings,But he who hastens to be rich will not go unpunished.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-21.htm." target="_blank">21</a>To show partiality is not good,Because for a piece of bread a man will transgress.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-22.htm." target="_blank">22</a>A man with an evil eye hastens after riches,And does not consider that poverty will come upon him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-23.htm." target="_blank">23</a>He who rebukes a man will find more favor afterward Than he who flatters with the tongue.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-24.htm." target="_blank">24</a>Whoever robs his father or his mother,And says, 'It is no transgression,'The same is companion to a destroyer.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-25.htm." target="_blank">25</a>He who is of a proud heart stirs up strife,But he who trusts in the Lord will be prospered.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-26.htm." target="_blank">26</a>He who trusts in his own heart is a fool,But whoever walks wisely will be delivered.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-27.htm." target="_blank">27</a>He who gives to the poor will not lack,But he who hides his eyes will have many curses.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-28.htm." target="_blank">28</a>When the wicked arise, men hide themselves;But when they perish, the righteous increase.</p>
