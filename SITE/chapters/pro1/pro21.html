<h2> proverbs 21 </h2>



<h4>The Lord Considers the Heart</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord,Like the rivers of water;He turns it wherever He wishes.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Every way of a man is right in his own eyes,But the Lord weighs the hearts.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>To do righteousness and justiceIs more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>A haughty look, a proud heart,And the plowing of the wicked are sin.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>The plans of the diligent lead surely to plenty,But those of everyone who is hasty, surely to poverty.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Getting treasures by a lying tongueIs the fleeting fantasy of those who seek death.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>The violence of the wicked will destroy them,Because they refuse to do justice.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>The way of a guilty man is perverse;But as for the pure, his work is right.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Better to dwell in a corner of a housetop,Than in a house shared with a contentious woman.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>The soul of the wicked desires evil;His neighbor finds no favor in his eyes.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>When the scoffer is punished, the simple is made wise;But when the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>The righteous God wisely considers the house of the wicked,Overthrowing the wicked for their wickedness.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Whoever shuts his ears to the cry of the poorWill also cry himself and not be heard.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>A gift in secret pacifies anger,And a bribe behind the back, strong wrath.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>It is a joy for the just to do justice,But destruction will come to the workers of iniquity.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>A man who wanders from the way of understandingWill rest in the assembly of the dead.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>He who loves pleasure will be a poor man;He who loves wine and oil will not be rich.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous,And the unfaithful for the upright.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Better to dwell in the wilderness,Than with a contentious and angry woman.</p>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>There is desirable treasure,And oil in the dwelling of the wise,But a foolish man squanders it.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>He who follows righteousness and mercyFinds life, righteousness, and honor.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>A wise man scales the city of the mighty,And brings down the trusted stronghold.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Whoever guards his mouth and tongueKeeps his soul from troubles.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>A proud and haughty man-"Scoffer" is his name;He acts with arrogant pride.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>The desire of the lazy man kills him,For his hands refuse to labor.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>He covets greedily all day long,But the righteous gives and does not spare.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination;How much more when he brings it with wicked intent!</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>A false witness shall perish,But the man who hears him will speak endlessly.</p>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>A wicked man hardens his face,But as for the upright, he establishes his way.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>There is no wisdom or understandingOr counsel against the Lord.</p>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>The horse is prepared for the day of battle,But deliverance is of the Lord.</p>
