<h2> Proverbs 5 </h2>

<h4>The Peril of Adultery</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-1.htm">1</a>My son, pay attention to my wisdom;
Lend your ear to my understanding,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-2.htm">2</a>That you may preserve discretion,
And your lips may keep knowledge.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-3.htm">3</a>For the lips of an immoral woman drip honey,
And her mouth is smoother than oil;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-4.htm">4</a>But in the end she is bitter as wormwood,
Sharp as a two-edged sword.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-5.htm">5</a>Her feet go down to death,
Her steps lay hold of hell.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-6.htm">6</a>Lest you ponder her path of life�
Her ways are unstable;
You do not know them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-7.htm">7</a>Therefore hear me now, my children,
And do not depart from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-8.htm">8</a>Remove your way far from her,
And do not go near the door of her house,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-9.htm">9</a>Lest you give your honor to others,
And your years to the cruel one;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-10.htm">10</a>Lest aliens be filled with your wealth,
And your labors go to the house of a foreigner;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-11.htm">11</a>And you mourn at last,
When your flesh and your body are consumed,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-12.htm">12</a>And say:
�How I have hated instruction,
And my heart despised correction!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-13.htm">13</a>I have not obeyed the voice of my teachers,
Nor inclined my ear to those who instructed me!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-14.htm">14</a>I was on the verge of total ruin,
In the midst of the assembly and congregation.�</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-15.htm">15</a>Drink water from your own cistern,
And running water from your own well.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-16.htm">16</a>Should your fountains be dispersed abroad,
Streams of water in the streets?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-17.htm">17</a>Let them be only your own,
And not for strangers with you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-18.htm">18</a>Let your fountain be blessed,
And rejoice with the wife of your youth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-19.htm">19</a>As a loving deer and a graceful doe,
Let her breasts satisfy you at all times;
And always be enraptured with her love.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-20.htm">20</a>For why should you, my son, be enraptured by an immoral woman,
And be embraced in the arms of a seductress?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-21.htm">21</a>For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord,
And He ponders all his paths.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-22.htm">22</a>His own iniquities entrap the wicked man,
And he is caught in the cords of his sin.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-23.htm">23</a>He shall die for lack of instruction,
And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</p>
