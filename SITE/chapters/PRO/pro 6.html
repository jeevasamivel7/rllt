<h2> Proverbs 6  </h2>

<h4>Dangerous Promises</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-1.htm">1</a>My son, if you become surety for your friend,
If you have shaken hands in pledge for a stranger,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-2.htm">2</a>You are snared by the words of your mouth;You are taken by the words of your mouth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-3.htm">3</a>So do this, my son, and deliver yourself;
For you have come into the hand of your friend:
Go and humble yourself;
Plead with your friend.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-4.htm">4</a>Give no sleep to your eyes,
Nor slumber to your eyelids.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-5.htm">5</a>Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,
And like a bird from the hand of the fowler.</p>
<h4>The Folly of Indolence</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-6.htm">6</a>Go to the ant, you sluggard!
Consider her ways and be wise,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-7.htm">7</a>Which, having no captain,
Overseer or ruler,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-8.htm">8</a>Provides her supplies in the summer,
And gathers her food in the harvest.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-9.htm">9</a>How long will you slumber, O sluggard?
When will you rise from your sleep?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-10.htm">10</a>A little sleep, a little slumber,
A little folding of the hands to sleep"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-11.htm">11</a>So shall your poverty come on you like a prowler,
And your need like an armed man.</p>
<h4>The Wicked Man</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-12.htm">12</a>A worthless person, a wicked man,
Walks with a perverse mouth;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-13.htm">13</a>He winks with his eyes,
He shuffles his feet,
He points with his fingers;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-14.htm">14</a>Perversity is in his heart,
He devises evil continually,
He sows discord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-15.htm">15</a>Therefore his calamity shall come suddenly;
Suddenly he shall be broken without remedy.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-16.htm">16</a>These six things the Lord hates,
Yes, seven are an abomination to Him:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-17.htm">17</a>A proud look,
A lying tongue,
Hands that shed innocent blood,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-18.htm">18</a>A heart that devises wicked plans,
Feet that are swift in running to evil,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-19.htm">19</a>A false witness who speaks lies,
And one who sows discord among brethren.</p>
<h4>Beware of Adultery</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-20.htm">20</a>My son, keep your father's command,
And do not forsake the law of your mother.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-21.htm">21</a>Bind them continually upon your heart;
Tie them around your neck.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-22.htm">22</a>When you roam, they will lead you;
When you sleep, they will keep you;
And when you awake, they will speak with you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-23.htm">23</a>For the commandment is a lamp,
And the law a light;
Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-24.htm">24</a>To keep you from the evil woman,
From the flattering tongue of a seductress.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-25.htm">25</a>Do not lust after her beauty in your heart,
Nor let her allure you with her eyelids.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-26.htm">26</a>For by means of a harlot
A man is reduced to a crust of bread;
And an adulteress will prey upon his precious life.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-27.htm">27</a>Can a man take fire to his bosom,
And his clothes not be burned?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-28.htm">28</a>Can one walk on hot coals,
And his feet not be seared?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-29.htm">29</a>So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife;
Whoever touches her shall not be innocent.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-30.htm">30</a>People do not despise a thief
If he steals to satisfy himself when he is starving.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-31.htm">31</a>Yet when he is found, he must restore sevenfold;
He may have to give up all the substance of his house.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-32.htm">32</a>Whoever commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding;
He who does so destroys his own soul.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-33.htm">33</a>Wounds and dishonor he will get,
And his reproach will not be wiped away.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-34.htm">34</a>For jealousy is a husband's fury;
Therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-35.htm">35</a>He will accept no recompense,
Nor will he be appeased though you give many gifts.</p>
