    <h2> Proverbs 10 </h2>
    
    <h4>Wise Sayings of Solomon</h4>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-1.htm" target="-blank">1</a>The proverbs of Solomon:

        A wise son makes a glad father,
        But a foolish son is the grief of his mother.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-2.htm" target="-blank">2</a>Treasures of wickedness profit nothing,
        But righteousness delivers from death.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-3.htm" target="-blank">3</a>The Lord will not allow the righteous soul to famish,
        But He casts away the desire of the wicked.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-4.htm" target="-blank">4</a>He who has a slack hand becomes poor,
        But the hand of the diligent makes rich.</p> 
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-5.htm" target="-blank">5</a>He who gathers in summer is a wise son;
        He who sleeps in harvest is a son who causes shame.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-6.htm" target="-blank">6</a>Blessings are on the head of the righteous,
        But violence covers the mouth of the wicked.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-7.htm" target="-blank">7</a>The memory of the righteous is blessed,
        But the name of the wicked will rot.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-8.htm" target="-blank">8</a>The wise in heart will receive commands,
        But a prating fool will fall.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-9.htm" target="-blank">9</a>He who walks with integrity walks securely,
        But he who perverts his ways will become known.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-10.htm" target="-blank">10</a>He who winks with the eye causes trouble,
        But a prating fool will fall.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-11.htm" target="-blank">11</a>The mouth of the righteous is a well of life,
        But violence covers the mouth of the wicked.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-12.htm" target="-blank">12</a>Hatred stirs up strife,
        But love covers all sins. </p>

    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-13.htm" target="-blank">13</a>Wisdom is found on the lips of him who has understanding,
        But a rod is for the back of him who is devoid of understanding.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-14.htm" target="-blank">14</a>Wise people store up knowledge,
        But the mouth of the foolish is near destruction.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-15.htm" target="-blank">15</a>The rich man’s wealth is his strong city;
        The destruction of the poor is their poverty.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-16.htm" target="-blank">16</a>The labor of the righteous leads to life,
        The wages of the wicked to sin.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-17.htm" target="-blank">17</a>He who keeps instruction is in the way of life,
        But he who refuses correction goes astray.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-18.htm" target="-blank">18</a>Whoever hides hatred has lying lips,
        And whoever spreads slander is a fool.</p>
        <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-19.htm" target="-blank">19</a>In the multitude of words sin is not lacking,
            But he who restrains his lips is wise.</p>
        <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-20.htm" target="-blank">20</a>The tongue of the righteous is choice silver;
            The heart of the wicked is worth little.</p>
        <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-21.htm" target="-blank">21</a>The lips of the righteous feed many,
            But fools die for lack of wisdom.</p>
        <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-22.htm" target="-blank">22</a>The blessing of the Lord makes one rich,
            And He adds no sorrow with it.</p>
        <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-23.htm" target="-blank">23</a>To do evil is like sport to a fool,
            But a man of understanding has wisdom.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-24.htm" target="-blank">24</a>The fear of the wicked will come upon him,
                And the desire of the righteous will be granted.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-25.htm" target="-blank">25</a>When the whirlwind passes by, the wicked is no more,
                But the righteous has an everlasting foundation.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-26.htm" target="-blank">26</a>As vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes,
                So is the lazy man to those who send him.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-27.htm" target="-blank">27</a>The fear of the Lord prolongs days,
                But the years of the wicked will be shortened.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-28.htm" target="-blank">28</a>The hope of the righteous will be gladness,
                But the expectation of the wicked will perish.</p>
                <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-29.htm" target="-blank">29</a>The way of the Lord is strength for the upright,
                    But destruction will come to the workers of iniquity.</p>
                <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-30.htm" target="-blank">30</a>The righteous will never be removed,
                    But the wicked will not inhabit the earth.</p>
                <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-31.htm" target="-blank">31</a>The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom,
                    But the perverse tongue will be cut out.</p>
                    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-32.htm" target="-blank">32</a>The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable,
                        But the mouth of the wicked what is perverse.</p>
