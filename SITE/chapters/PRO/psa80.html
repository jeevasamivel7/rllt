<h4> Prayer for Israel’s Restoration  </h4>
<h5>  To the Chief Musician. Set to “The Lilies.” A Testimony of Asaph. A Psalm. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel,You who lead Joseph like a flock;You who dwell between the cherubim, shine forth!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh,Stir up Your strength,And come and save us!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Restore us, O God;Cause Your face to shine,And we shall be saved!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>O Lord God of hosts,How long will You be angry Against the prayer of Your people?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>You have fed them with the bread of tears,And given them tears to drink in great measure.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>You have made us a strife to our neighbors,And our enemies laugh among themselves.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Restore us, O God of hosts;Cause Your face to shine,And we shall be saved!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>You have brought a vine out of Egypt;You have cast out the nations, and planted it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>You prepared room for it,And caused it to take deep root,And it filled the land.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>The hills were covered with its shadow,And the mighty cedars with its boughs.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>She sent out her boughs to the Sea,And her branches to the River.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Why have You broken down her hedges,So that all who pass by the way pluck her fruit?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>The boar out of the woods uproots it,And the wild beast of the field devours it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Return, we beseech You, O God of hosts;Look down from heaven and see,And visit this vine</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>And the vineyard which Your right hand has planted,And the branch that You made strong for Yourself.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>It is burned with fire, it is cut down;They perish at the rebuke of Your countenance.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand,Upon the son of man whom You made strong for Yourself.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Then we will not turn back from You;Revive us, and we will call upon Your name.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Restore us, O Lord God of hosts;Cause Your face to shine,And we shall be saved!</p>
