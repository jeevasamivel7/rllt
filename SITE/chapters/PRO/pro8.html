    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-1.htm">1</a>  Does not wisdom cry out,
        And understanding lift up her voice? </p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-2.htm">2</a> She takes her stand on the top of the high hill,
        Beside the way, where the paths meet.  </p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-3.htm">3</a> She cries out by the gates, at the entry of the city,
        At the entrance of the doors:</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-4.htm">4</a>“To you, O men, I call,
        And my voice is to the sons of men. </p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-5.htm">5</a> O you simple ones, understand prudence,
        And you fools, be of an understanding heart. </p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-6.htm">6</a>Listen, for I will speak of excellent things,
        And from the opening of my lips will come right things; </p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-7.htm">7</a>For my mouth will speak truth;
        Wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-8.htm">8</a>All the words of my mouth are with righteousness;
        Nothing crooked or perverse is in them.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-9.htm">9</a> They are all plain to him who understands,
        And right to those who find knowledge.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-10.htm">10</a>Receive my instruction, and not silver,
        And knowledge rather than choice gold;</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-11.htm">11</a>  For wisdom is better than rubies,
        And all the things one may desire cannot be compared with her.
        </p><br>

    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-12.htm">12</a>  “I, wisdom, dwell with prudence,
        And find out knowledge and discretion. </p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-13htm">13</a> The fear of the Lord is to hate evil;
        Pride and arrogance and the evil way And the perverse mouth I hate.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-14.htm">14</a>Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom;
        I am understanding, I have strength. </p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-15.htm">15</a>By me kings reign,
        And rulers decree justice.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-16.htm">16</a> By me princes rule, and nobles,
        All the judges of the earth. </p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-17.htm">17</a> I love those who love me,
        And those who seek me diligently will find me. </p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-18.htm">18</a>Riches and honor are with me,
        Enduring riches and righteousness. </p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-19.htm">19</a>My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold,
        And my revenue than choice silver. </p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-20.htm">20</a> I traverse the way of righteousness,
        In the midst of the paths of justice,</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-21.htm">21</a>  That I may cause those who love me to inherit wealth,
        That I may fill their treasuries. </p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-22.htm">22</a> “The Lord possessed me at the beginning of His way,
        Before His works of old. </p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-23.htm">23</a> I have been established from everlasting,
        From the beginning, before there was ever an earth.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-24.htm">24</a>When there were no depths I was brought forth,
            When there were no fountains abounding with water.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-25.htm">25</a> Before the mountains were settled,
        Before the hills, I was brought forth; </p>
     <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-26.htm">26</a>While as yet He had not made the earth or the fields,
        Or the primal dust of the world.</p>
     <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-27.htm">27</a>When He prepared the heavens, I was there,
        When He drew a circle on the face of the deep,</p>
     <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-28.htm">28</a>When He established the clouds above,
        When He strengthened the fountains of the deep,</p>
     <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-29.htm">29</a>When He assigned to the sea its limit,
        So that the waters would not transgress His command,
        When He marked out the foundations of the earth,</p>
     <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-30.htm">30</a>Then I was beside Him as a master craftsman;
        And I was daily His delight, Rejoicing always before Him,</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-31.htm">31</a>Rejoicing in His inhabited world,
        And my delight was with the sons of men.</p>
        <br>

    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-32.htm">32</a>“Now therefore, listen to me, my children,
        For blessed are those who keep my ways.</p>
  <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-33.htm">33</a>Hear instruction and be wise,
    And do not disdain it.</p>
  <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-34.htm">34</a>Blessed is the man who listens to me,
    Watching daily at my gates,  Waiting at the posts of my doors. </p>
   <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-35.htm">35</a> For whoever finds me finds life,
    And obtains favor from the Lord;</p>
   <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-36.htm">36</a> But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul;
    All those who hate me love death.”</p>
