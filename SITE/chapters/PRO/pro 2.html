<h2> PROVERBS 2 </h2>

<h4>The Value of Wisdom</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-1.htm">1</a>  My son, if you receive my words,
And treasure my commands within you, </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-2.htm">2</a> So that you incline your ear to wisdom,
And apply your heart to understanding;  </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-3.htm">3</a>   Yes, if you cry out for discernment,
And lift up your voice for understanding,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-4.htm">4</a>  If you seek her as silver,
And search for her as for hidden treasures; </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-5.htm">5</a> Then you will understand the fear of the Lord,
And find the knowledge of God. </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-6.htm">6</a> For the Lord gives wisdom;
From His mouth come knowledge and understanding; </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-7.htm">7</a>He stores up sound wisdom for the upright;
He is a shield to those who walk uprightly;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-8.htm">8</a> He guards the paths of justice,
And preserves the way of His saints.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-9.htm">9</a> Then you will understand righteousness and justice,
Equity and every good path.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-10.htm">10</a>When wisdom enters your heart,
And knowledge is pleasant to your soul,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-11.htm">11</a>  Discretion will preserve you;
Understanding will keep you, </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-12.htm">12</a>  To deliver you from the way of evil,
From the man who speaks perverse things, </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-13htm">13</a>  From those who leave the paths of uprightness
To walk in the ways of darkness; </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-14.htm">14</a> Who rejoice in doing evil,
And delight in the perversity of the wicked;  </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-15.htm">15</a>Whose ways are crooked,
And who are devious in their paths;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-16.htm">16</a>  To deliver you from the immoral woman,
From the seductress who flatters with her words, </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-17.htm">17</a>  Who forsakes the companion of her youth,
And forgets the covenant of her God. </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-18.htm">18</a>  For her house leads down to death,
And her paths to the dead; </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-19.htm">19</a> None who go to her return,
Nor do they regain the paths of life  </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-20.htm">20</a>   So you may walk in the way of goodness,
And keep to the paths of righteousness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-21.htm">21</a>  For the upright will dwell in the land,
And the blameless will remain in it; </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-22.htm">22</a>  But the wicked will be cut off from the earth,
And the unfaithful will be uprooted from it. </p>
