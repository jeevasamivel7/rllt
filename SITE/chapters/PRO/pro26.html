<h2> Proverbs 26  </h2>

<h4> Honor Is Not Fitting for a Fool  </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-1.htm." target="_blank">1</a>As snow in summer and rain in harvest,So honor is not fitting for a fool.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-2.htm." target="_blank">2</a>Like a flitting sparrow, like a flying swallow,So a curse without cause shall not alight.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-3.htm." target="_blank">3</a>A whip for the horse,A bridle for the donkey,And a rod for the fool�s back.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-4.htm." target="_blank">4</a>Do not answer a fool according to his folly,Lest you also be like him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-5.htm." target="_blank">5</a>Answer a fool according to his folly,Lest he be wise in his own eyes.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-6.htm." target="_blank">6</a>He who sends a message by the hand of a foolCuts off his own feet and drinks violence.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-7.htm." target="_blank">7</a>Like the legs of the lame that hang limp Is a proverb in the mouth of fools.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-8.htm." target="_blank">8</a>Like one who binds a stone in a sling Is he who gives honor to a fool.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-9.htm." target="_blank">9</a>Like a thorn that goes into the hand of a drunkard Is a proverb in the mouth of fools.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-10.htm." target="_blank">10</a>The great God who formed everything Gives the fool his hire and the transgressor his wages.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-11.htm." target="_blank">11</a>As a dog returns to his own vomit,So a fool repeats his folly.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-12.htm." target="_blank">12</a>Do you see a man wise in his own eyes?There is more hope for a fool than for him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-13.htm." target="_blank">13</a>The lazy man says, �There is a lion in the road!A fierce lion is in the streets!�</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-14.htm." target="_blank">14</a>As a door turns on its hinges,So does the lazy man on his bed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-15.htm." target="_blank">15</a>The lazy man buries his hand in the bowl;It wearies him to bring it back to his mouth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-16.htm." target="_blank">16</a>The lazy man is wiser in his own eyes Than seven men who can answer sensibly.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-17.htm." target="_blank">17</a>He who passes by and meddles in a quarrel not his own Is like one who takes a dog by the ears.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-18.htm." target="_blank">18</a>Like a madman who throws firebrands, arrows, and death,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-19.htm." target="_blank">19</a>Is the man who deceives his neighbor,And says, �I was only joking!�</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-20.htm." target="_blank">20</a>Where there is no wood, the fire goes out;And where there is no talebearer, strife ceases.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-21.htm." target="_blank">21</a>As charcoal is to burning coals, and wood to fire,So is a contentious man to kindle strife.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-22.htm." target="_blank">22</a>The words of a talebearer are like tasty trifles,And they go down into the inmost body.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-23.htm." target="_blank">23</a>Fervent lips with a wicked heart Are like earthenware covered with silver dross.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-24.htm." target="_blank">24</a>He who hates, disguises it with his lips,And lays up deceit within himself;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-25.htm." target="_blank">25</a>When he speaks kindly, do not believe him,For there are seven abominations in his heart;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-26.htm." target="_blank">26</a>Though his hatred is covered by deceit,His wickedness will be revealed before the assembly.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-27.htm." target="_blank">27</a>Whoever digs a pit will fall into it,And he who rolls a stone will have it roll back on him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-28.htm." target="_blank">28</a>A lying tongue hates those who are crushed by it,And a flattering mouth works ruin.</p>
