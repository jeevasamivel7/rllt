<h2>Psalms 43  </h2>

<h4>  Prayer to God in Time of Trouble </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-1.htm">1</a>Vindicate me, O God,And plead my cause against an ungodly nation;Oh, deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-2.htm">2</a>For You are the God of my strength;Why do You cast me off?Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-3.htm">3</a>Oh, send out Your light and Your truth!Let them lead me;Let them bring me to Your holy hillAnd to Your tabernacle.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-4.htm">4</a>Then I will go to the altar of God,To God my exceeding joy;And on the harp I will praise You,O God, my God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-5.htm">5</a>Why are you cast down, O my soul?And why are you disquieted within me?Hope in God;For I shall yet praise Him,The help of my countenance and my God.</p>
