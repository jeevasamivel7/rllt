<h4>Further Wise Sayings of Solomon</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>These also are proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>It is the glory of God to conceal a matter,But the glory of kings is to search out a matter.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>As the heavens for height and the earth for depth,So the heart of kings is unsearchable.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Take away the dross from silver,And it will go to the silversmith for jewelry.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Take away the wicked from before the king,And his throne will be established in righteousness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Do not exalt yourself in the presence of the king,And do not stand in the place of the great;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>For it is better that he say to you,�Come up here,�Than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince,Whom your eyes have seen.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Do not go hastily to court;For what will you do in the end,When your neighbor has put you to shame?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Debate your case with your neighbor,And do not disclose the secret to another</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Lest he who hears it expose your shame,And your reputation be ruined.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>A word fitly spoken is like apples of goldIn settings of silver.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Like an earring of gold and an ornament of fine goldIs a wise rebuker to an obedient ear.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Like the cold of snow in time of harvestIs a faithful messenger to those who send him,For he refreshes the soul of his masters.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Whoever falsely boasts of givingIs like clouds and wind without rain.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>By long forbearance a ruler is persuaded,And a gentle tongue breaks a bone.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Have you found honey?Eat only as much as you need,Lest you be filled with it and vomit.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Seldom set foot in your neighbor�s house,Lest he become weary of you and hate you.</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>A man who bears false witness against his neighborIs like a club, a sword, and a sharp arrow.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of troubleIs like a bad tooth and a foot out of joint.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Like one who takes away a garment in cold weather,And like vinegar on soda,Is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat;And if he is thirsty, give him water to drink;</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>For so you will heap coals of fire on his head,And the Lord will reward you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>The north wind brings forth rain,And a backbiting tongue an angry countenance.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>It is better to dwell in a corner of a housetop,Than in a house shared with a contentious woman.</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>As cold water to a weary soul,So is good news from a far country.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>A righteous man who falters before the wickedIs like a murky spring and a polluted well.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>It is not good to eat much honey;So to seek one�s own glory is not glory.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>Whoever has no rule over his own spirit Is like a city broken down, without walls.</p>
