<h5>  To the Chief Musician. Set to “The Silent Dove in Distant Lands.” A Michtam of David when the Philistines captured him in Gath. </h5>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Be merciful to me, O God, for man would swallow me up;Fighting all day he oppresses me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>My enemies would hound me all day,For there are many who fight against me, O Most High.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Whenever I am afraid,I will trust in You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>In God (I will praise His word),In God I have put my trust;I will not fear.What can flesh do to me?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>All day they twist my words;All their thoughts are against me for evil.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>They gather together,They hide, they mark my steps,When they lie in wait for my life.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Shall they escape by iniquity?In anger cast down the peoples, O God!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>You number my wanderings;Put my tears into Your bottle;Are they not in Your book?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>When I cry out to You,Then my enemies will turn back;This I know, because God is for me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>In God (I will praise His word),In the Lord (I will praise His word),</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>In God I have put my trust;I will not be afraid.What can man do to me?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Vows made to You are binding upon me, O God;I will render praises to You,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>For You have delivered my soul from death.Have You not kept my feet from falling,That I may walk before GodIn the light of the living?</p>
