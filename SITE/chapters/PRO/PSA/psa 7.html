<h2> Psalms 7 </h2>

<h4>Prayer and Praise for Deliverance from Enemies
A Meditation of David, which he sang to the Lord concerning the words of Cush, a Benjamite.</h4>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-1.htm">1</a>O Lord my God, in You I put my trust;Save me from all those who persecute me;And deliver me,</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-2.htm">2</a>Lest they tear me like a lion,Rending me in pieces, while there is none to deliver.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-3.htm">3</a>O Lord my God, if I have done this:If there is iniquity in my hands,</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-4.htm">4</a>If I have repaid evil to him who was at peace with me,Or have plundered my enemy without cause,</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-5.htm">5</a>Let the enemy pursue me and overtake me;Yes, let him trample my life to the earth,And lay my honor in the dust. Selah</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-6.htm">6</a>Arise, O Lord, in Your anger;Lift Yourself up because of the rage of my enemies;Rise up for me to the judgment You have commanded!</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-7.htm">7</a>So the congregation of the peoples shall surround You;For their sakes, therefore, return on high.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-8.htm">8</a>The Lord shall judge the peoples;Judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness,And according to my integrity within me.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-9.htm">9</a>Oh, let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end,But establish the just;For the righteous God tests the hearts and minds</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-10.htm">10</a>My defense is of God,Who saves the upright in heart.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-11.htm">11</a>God is a just judge,And God is angry with the wicked every day.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-12.htm">12</a>If he does not turn back,He will sharpen His sword;He bends His bow and makes it ready.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-13.htm">13</a>He also prepares for Himself instruments of death;He makes His arrows into fiery shafts.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-14.htm">14</a>Behold, the wicked brings forth iniquity;Yes, he conceives trouble and brings forth falsehood.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-15.htm">15</a>He made a pit and dug it out,And has fallen into the ditch which he made.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-16.htm">16</a>His trouble shall return upon his own head,And his violent dealing shall come down on his own crown.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-17.htm">17</a>I will praise the Lord according to His righteousness,And will sing praise to the name of the Lord Most High.</p>
