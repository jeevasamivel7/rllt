<h5> A Prayer of David.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Bow down Your ear, O Lord, hear me;For I am poor and needy.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Preserve my life, for I am holy;You are my God;Save Your servant who trusts in You!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Be merciful to me, O Lord,For I cry to You all day long.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Rejoice the soul of Your servant,For to You, O Lord, I lift up my soul.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>For You, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive,And abundant in mercy to all those who call upon You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86.6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer;And attend to the voice of my supplications.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>In the day of my trouble I will call upon You,For You will answer me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Among the gods there is none like You, O Lord;Nor are there any works like Your works.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>All nations whom You have made Shall come and worship before You, O Lord,And shall glorify Your name.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>For You are great, and do wondrous things;You alone are God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Teach me Your way, O Lord;I will walk in Your truth;Unite my heart to fear Your name.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>I will praise You, O Lord my God, with all my heart,And I will glorify Your name forevermore.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>For great is Your mercy toward me,And You have delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>O God, the proud have risen against me,And a mob of violent men have sought my life,And have not set You before them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>But You, O Lord, are a God full of compassion, and gracious,Longsuffering and abundant in mercy and truth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Oh, turn to me, and have mercy on me!Give Your strength to Your servant,And save the son of Your maidservant.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Show me a sign for good,That those who hate me may see it and be ashamed,Because You, Lord, have helped me and comforted me.</p>
