<h2> Psalms 23 </h2>

<h4> The Lord the Shepherd of His People  </h4>
<h5> A Psalm of David.  </h5>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-1.htm">1</a>The Lord is my shepherd;I shall not want.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-2.htm">2</a>He makes me to lie down in green pastures;He leads me beside the still waters.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-3.htm">3</a>He restores my soul;He leads me in the paths of righteousnessFor His name's sake.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm">4</a>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,I will fear no evil;For You are with me;Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-5.htm">5</a>You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;You anoint my head with oil;My cup runs over.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-6.htm">6</a>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow meAll the days of my life;And I will dwell in the house of the LordForever.</p>
