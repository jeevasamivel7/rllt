<h2> Psalms 90 </h2>

<h4>  The Eternity of God, and Man’s Frailty </h4>
<h5>  A Prayer of Moses the man of God. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Lord, You have been our dwelling place in all generations.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Before the mountains were brought forth,Or ever You had formed the earth and the world,Even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>You turn man to destruction,And say, “Return, O children of men.”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>For a thousand years in Your sight Are like yesterday when it is past,And like a watch in the night.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>You carry them away like a flood;They are like a sleep.In the morning they are like grass which grows up:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>In the morning it flourishes and grows up;In the evening it is cut down and withers.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>For we have been consumed by Your anger,And by Your wrath we are terrified.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>You have set our iniquities before You,Our secret sins in the light of Your countenance.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>For all our days have passed away in Your wrath;We finish our years like a sigh.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>The days of our lives are seventy years;And if by reason of strength they are eighty years,Yet their boast is only labor and sorrow;For it is soon cut off, and we fly away.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Who knows the power of Your anger?For as the fear of You, so is Your wrath.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>So teach us to number our days,That we may gain a heart of wisdom.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Return, O Lord!How long?And have compassion on Your servants.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Oh, satisfy us early with Your mercy,That we may rejoice and be glad all our days!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Make us glad according to the days in which You have afflicted us,The years in which we have seen evil.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Let Your work appear to Your servants,And Your glory to their children.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us,And establish the work of our hands for us;Yes, establish the work of our hands.</p>
