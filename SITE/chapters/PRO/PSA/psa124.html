<h4>  The Lord the Defense of His People </h4>
<h5>  A Song of Ascents. Of David. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/124-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>"If it had not been the Lord who was on our side,"Let Israel now say-</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/124-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>"If it had not been the Lord who was on our side,When men rose up against us,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/124-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Then they would have swallowed us alive,When their wrath was kindled against us;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/124-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Then the waters would have overwhelmed us,The stream would have gone over our soul;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/124-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Then the swollen waters Would have gone over our soul."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/124-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Blessed be the Lord,Who has not given us as prey to their teeth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/124-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Our soul has escaped as a bird from the snare of the fowlers;The snare is broken, and we have escaped.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/124-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Our help is in the name of the Lord,Who made heaven and earth.</p>
