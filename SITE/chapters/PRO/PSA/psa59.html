<h2>Psalms 59  </h2>

<h4>  The Assured Judgment of the Wicked </h4>
<h5>  To the Chief Musician. Set to “Do Not Destroy.” A Michtam of David when Saul sent men, and they watched the house in order to kill him. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Deliver me from my enemies, O my God;Defend me from those who rise up against me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Deliver me from the workers of iniquity,And save me from bloodthirsty men.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>For look, they lie in wait for my life;The mighty gather against me,Not for my transgression nor for my sin, O Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>They run and prepare themselves through no fault of mine.Awake to help me, and behold!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>You therefore, O Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel,Awake to punish all the nations;Do not be merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>At evening they return,They growl like a dog,And go all around the city.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Indeed, they belch with their mouth;Swords are in their lips;For they say, “Who hears?”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>But You, O Lord, shall laugh at them;You shall have all the nations in derision.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>I will wait for You, O You his Strength;For God is my defense.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>My God of mercy shall come to meet me;God shall let me see my desire on my enemies.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Do not slay them, lest my people forget;Scatter them by Your power,And bring them down,O Lord our shield.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips,Let them even be taken in their pride,And for the cursing and lying which they speak.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Consume them in wrath, consume them,That they may not be;And let them know that God rules in JacobTo the ends of the earth. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>And at evening they return,They growl like a dog,And go all around the city.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>They wander up and down for food,And howl if they are not satisfied.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>But I will sing of Your power;Yes, I will sing aloud of Your mercy in the morning;For You have been my defenseAnd refuge in the day of my trouble.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>To You, O my Strength, I will sing praises;For God is my defense,My God of mercy.</p>
