<h2>Psalms 62   </h2>

<h4> A Calm Resolve to Wait for the Salvation of God  </h4>
<h5>  To the Chief Musician. To Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Truly my soul silently waits for God;From Him comes my salvation.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>He only is my rock and my salvation;He is my defense;I shall not be greatly moved.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>How long will you attack a man?You shall be slain, all of you,Like a leaning wall and a tottering fence.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>They only consult to cast him down from his high position;They delight in lies;They bless with their mouth,But they curse inwardly. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>My soul, wait silently for God alone,For my expectation is from Him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>He only is my rock and my salvation;He is my defense;I shall not be moved.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>In God is my salvation and my glory;The rock of my strength,And my refuge, is in God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Trust in Him at all times, you people;Pour out your heart before Him;God is a refuge for us. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Surely men of low degree are a vapor,Men of high degree are a lie;If they are weighed on the scales,They are altogether lighter than vapor.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Do not trust in oppression,Nor vainly hope in robbery;If riches increase,Do not set your heart on them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>God has spoken once,Twice I have heard this:That power belongs to God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Also to You, O Lord, belongs mercy;For You render to each one according to his work.</p>
