<h2> Psalms 30  </h2>

<h4> The Blessedness of Answered Prayer  </h4>
<h5> A Psalm. A Song at the dedication of the house of David.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-1.htm">1</a>I will extol You, O Lord, for You have lifted me up,And have not let my foes rejoice over me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-2.htm">2</a>O Lord my God, I cried out to You,And You healed me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-3.htm">3</a>Lord, You brought my soul up from the grave;You have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-4.htm">4</a>Sing praise to the Lord, you saints of His,And give thanks at the remembrance of His holy name.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-5.htm">5</a>For His anger is but for a moment,His favor is for life;Weeping may endure for a night,But joy comes in the morning.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-6.htm">6</a>Now in my prosperity I said,"I shall never be moved."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-7.htm">7</a>Lord, by Your favor You have made my mountain stand strong;You hid Your face, and I was troubled.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-8.htm">8</a>I cried out to You, O Lord;And to the Lord I made supplication:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-9.htm">9</a>"What profit is there in my blood,When I go down to the pit?Will the dust praise You?Will it declare Your truth?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-10.htm">10</a>Hear, O Lord, and have mercy on me;Lord, be my helper!"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-11.htm">11</a>You have turned for me my mourning into dancing;You have put off my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-12.htm">12</a>To the end that my glory may sing praise to You and not be silent.O Lord my God, I will give thanks to You forever.</p>
