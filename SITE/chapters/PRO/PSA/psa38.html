<h2>Psalms 38  </h2>

<h4> Prayer in Time of Chastening  </h4>
<h5>  A Psalm of David. To bring to remembrance. </h5>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-1.htm">1</a>O Lord, do not rebuke me in Your wrath,Nor chasten me in Your hot displeasure!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-2.htm">2</a>For Your arrows pierce me deeply,And Your hand presses me down.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-3.htm">3</a>There is no soundness in my flesh Because of Your anger,Nor any health in my bonesBecause of my sin.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-4.htm">4</a>For my iniquities have gone over my head;Like a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-5.htm">5</a>My wounds are foul and festeringBecause of my foolishness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-6.htm">6</a>I am troubled, I am bowed down greatly;I go mourning all the day long.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-7.htm">7</a>For my loins are full of inflammation,And there is no soundness in my flesh.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-8.htm">8</a>I am feeble and severely broken;I groan because of the turmoil of my heart.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-9.htm">9</a>Lord, all my desire is before You;And my sighing is not hidden from You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-10.htm">10</a>My heart pants, my strength fails me;As for the light of my eyes, it also has gone from me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-11.htm">11</a>My loved ones and my friends stand aloof from my plague,And my relatives stand afar off.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-12.htm">12</a>Those also who seek my life lay snares for me;Those who seek my hurt speak of destruction,And plan deception all the day long.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-13.htm">13</a>But I, like a deaf man, do not hear;And I am like a mute who does not open his mouth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-14.htm">14</a>Thus I am like a man who does not hear,And in whose mouth is no response.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-15.htm">15</a>For in You, O Lord, I hope;You will hear, O Lord my God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-16.htm">16</a>For I said, "Hear me, lest they rejoice over me,Lest, when my foot slips, they exalt themselves against me."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-17.htm">17</a>For I am ready to fall,And my sorrow is continually before me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-18.htm">18</a>For I will declare my iniquity;I will be in anguish over my sin.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-19.htm">19</a>But my enemies are vigorous, and they are strong;And those who hate me wrongfully have multiplied.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-20.htm">20</a>Those also who render evil for good,They are my adversaries, because I follow what is good.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-21.htm">21</a>Do not forsake me, O Lord;O my God, be not far from me!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-22.htm">22</a>Make haste to help me,O Lord, my salvation!</p>
