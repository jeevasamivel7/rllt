<h2> Psalms 142 </h2>

<h4>  A Plea for Relief from Persecutors </h4>
<h5>A Contemplation of David. A Prayer when he was in the cave.   </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>I cry out to the Lord with my voice;With my voice to the Lord I make my supplication.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>I pour out my complaint before Him;I declare before Him my trouble.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>When my spirit was overwhelmed within me,Then You knew my path.In the way in which I walk They have secretly set a snare for me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Look on my right hand and see,For there is no one who acknowledges me;Refuge has failed me;No one cares for my soul.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>I cried out to You, O Lord:I said, "You are my refuge,My portion in the land of the living.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Attend to my cry,For I am brought very low;Deliver me from my persecutors,For they are stronger than I.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/142-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Bring my soul out of prison,That I may praise Your name;The righteous shall surround me,For You shall deal bountifully with me.�</p>
