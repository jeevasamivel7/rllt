<h2> Psalms 53 </h2>

<h4>Folly of the Godless, and the Restoration of Israel   </h4>
<h5> To the Chief Musician. Set to “Mahalath.” A Contemplation of David.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/53-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>The fool has said in his heart,“There is no God.”They are corrupt, and have done abominable iniquity;There is none who does good.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/53-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>God looks down from heaven upon the children of men,To see if there are any who understand, who seek God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/53-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Every one of them has turned aside;They have together become corrupt;There is none who does good,No, not one.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/53-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge,Who eat up my people as they eat bread,And do not call upon God?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/53-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>There they are in great fearWhere no fear was,For God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you;You have put them to shame,Because God has despised them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/53-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!When God brings back the captivity of His people,Let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad.</p>
