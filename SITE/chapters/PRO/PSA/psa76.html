<h2> Psalms 76 </h2>

<h4> The Majesty of God in Judgment  </h4>
<h5> To the Chief Musician. On stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph. A Song.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>In Judah God is known;His name is great in Israel.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>In Salem also is His tabernacle,And His dwelling place in Zion.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>There He broke the arrows of the bow,The shield and sword of battle. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>You are more glorious and excellent Than the mountains of prey.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>The stouthearted were plundered;They have sunk into their sleep;And none of the mighty men have found the use of their hands.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob,Both the chariot and horse were cast into a dead sleep.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>You, Yourself, are to be feared;And who may stand in Your presence When once You are angry?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>You caused judgment to be heard from heaven;The earth feared and was still,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>When God arose to judgment,To deliver all the oppressed of the earth. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Surely the wrath of man shall praise You;With the remainder of wrath You shall gird Yourself.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Make vows to the Lord your God, and pay them;Let all who are around Him bring presents to Him who ought to be feared.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>He shall cut off the spirit of princes;He is awesome to the kings of the earth.</p>
