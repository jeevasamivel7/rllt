<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>The Lord shall send the rod of Your strength out of Zion.Rule in the midst of Your enemies!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Your people shall be volunteers In the day of Your power;In the beauties of holiness, from the womb of the morning,You have the dew of Your youth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>The Lord has sworn And will not relent,"You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>The Lord is at Your right hand;He shall execute kings in the day of His wrath.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>He shall judge among the nations,He shall fill the places with dead bodies,He shall execute the heads of many countries.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>He shall drink of the brook by the wayside;Therefore He shall lift up the head.</p>
