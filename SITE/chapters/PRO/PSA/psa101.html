<h2>Psalms 101  </h2>

<h4>  Promised Faithfulness to the Lord </h4>
<h5>  A Psalm of David. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>I will sing of mercy and justice;To You, O Lord, I will sing praises.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>I will behave wisely in a perfect way.Oh, when will You come to me?I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>I will set nothing wicked before my eyes;I hate the work of those who fall away;It shall not cling to me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>A perverse heart shall depart from me;I will not know wickedness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Whoever secretly slanders his neighbor,Him I will destroy;The one who has a haughty look and a proud heart,Him I will not endure.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>My eyes shall be on the faithful of the land,That they may dwell with me;He who walks in a perfect way,He shall serve me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>He who works deceit shall not dwell within my house;He who tells lies shall not continue in my presence.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Early I will destroy all the wicked of the land,That I may cut off all the evildoers from the city of the Lord.</p>
