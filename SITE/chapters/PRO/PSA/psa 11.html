<h2> Psalms 11  </h2>

<h4>Faith in the Lord's Righteousness
To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.</h4>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-1.htm">1</a>In the Lord I put my trust;How can you say to my soul,"Flee as a bird to your mountain"?</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-2.htm">2</a>For look! The wicked bend their bow,They make ready their arrow on the string,That they may shoot secretly at the upright in heart.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-3.htm">3</a>If the foundations are destroyed,What can the righteous do?</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-4.htm">4</a>The Lord is in His holy temple,The Lord's throne is in heaven;His eyes behold,His eyelids test the sons of men.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-5.htm">5</a>The Lord tests the righteous,But the wicked and the one who loves violence His soul hates.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-6.htm">6</a>Upon the wicked He will rain coals;Fire and brimstone and a burning windShall be the portion of their cup.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-7.htm">7</a>For the Lord is righteous,He loves righteousness;His countenance beholds the upright.</p>
