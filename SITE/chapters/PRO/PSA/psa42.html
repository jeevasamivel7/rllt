<h2>Psalms 42  </h2>

<h4> Yearning for God in the Midst of Distresses  </h4>
<h5> To the Chief Musician. A Contemplation of the sons of Korah.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-1.htm">1</a>As the deer pants for the water brooks,So pants my soul for You, O God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-2.htm">2</a>My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.When shall I come and appear before God?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-3.htm">3</a>My tears have been my food day and night,While they continually say to me,"Where is your God?"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-4.htm">4</a>When I remember these things,I pour out my soul within me.For I used to go with the multitude;I went with them to the house of God,With the voice of joy and praise,With a multitude that kept a pilgrim feast.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-5.htm">5</a>Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why are you disquieted within me?Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him For the help of His countenance.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-6.htm">6</a>O my God, my soul is cast down within me;Therefore I will remember You from the land of the Jordan,And from the heights of Hermon,From the Hill Mizar.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-7.htm">7</a>Deep calls unto deep at the noise of Your waterfalls;All Your waves and billows have gone over me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-8.htm">8</a>The Lord will command His lovingkindness in the daytime,And in the night His song shall be with me" A prayer to the God of my life.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-9.htm">9</a>I will say to God my Rock,"Why have You forgotten me?Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-10.htm">10</a>As with a breaking of my bones,My enemies reproach me,While they say to me all day long,"Where is your God?"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-11.htm">11</a>Why are you cast down, O my soul?And why are you disquieted within me?Hope in God;For I shall yet praise Him,The help of my countenance and my God.</p>
