<h2> Psalms 14 </h2>

<h4>Folly of the Godless, and God's Final Triumph</h4>
To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.</p>.
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">1</a>The fool has said in his heart,"here is no God."They are corrupt,They have done abominable works,There is none who does good.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-2.htm">2</a>The Lord looks down from heaven upon the children of men,To see if there are any who understand, who seek God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-3.htm">3</a>They have all turned aside,They have together become corrupt;There is none who does good,No, not one.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-4.htm">4</a>Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge,Who eat up my people as they eat bread,And do not call on the Lord?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-5.htm">5</a>There they are in great fear,For God is with the generation of the righteous.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-6.htm">6</a>You shame the counsel of the poor,But the Lord is his refuge.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-7.htm">7</a>Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!When the Lord brings back the captivity of His people,Let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad.</p>
