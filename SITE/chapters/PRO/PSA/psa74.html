<h2> Psalms 74 </h2>

<h4> A Plea for Relief from Oppressors  </h4>
<h5> A Contemplation of Asaph.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>O God, why have You cast us off forever?Why does Your anger smoke against the sheep of Your pasture?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Remember Your congregation, which You have purchased of old,The tribe of Your inheritance, which You have redeemed—This Mount Zion where You have dwelt.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Lift up Your feet to the perpetual desolations.The enemy has damaged everything in the sanctuary.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Your enemies roar in the midst of Your meeting place;They set up their banners for signs.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>They seem like men who lift up Axes among the thick trees.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>And now they break down its carved work, all at once,With axes and hammers.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>They have set fire to Your sanctuary;They have defiled the dwelling place of Your name to the ground.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>They said in their hearts,“Let us destroy them altogether.”They have burned up all the meeting places of God in the land.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>We do not see our signs;There is no longer any prophet;Nor is there any among us who knows how long.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>O God, how long will the adversary reproach?Will the enemy blaspheme Your name forever?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Why do You withdraw Your hand, even Your right hand?Take it out of Your bosom and destroy them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>For God is my King from of old,Working salvation in the midst of the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>You divided the sea by Your strength;You broke the heads of the sea serpents in the waters.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces,And gave him as food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>You broke open the fountain and the flood;You dried up mighty rivers.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>The day is Yours, the night also is Yours;You have prepared the light and the sun.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>You have set all the borders of the earth;You have made summer and winter.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Remember this, that the enemy has reproached, O Lord,And that a foolish people has blasphemed Your name.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Oh, do not deliver the life of Your turtledove to the wild beast!Do not forget the life of Your poor forever.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Have respect to the covenant;For the dark places of the earth are full of the haunts of cruelty.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Oh, do not let the oppressed return ashamed!Let the poor and needy praise Your name.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Arise, O God, plead Your own cause;Remember how the foolish man reproaches You daily.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Do not forget the voice of Your enemies;The tumult of those who rise up against You increases continually.</p>
