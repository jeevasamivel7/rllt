    <h2> Psalms 24 </h2>
    
    <h4> The King of Glory and His Kingdom</h4>
    <h5> A Psalm of David.  </h5>
    
    
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-1.htm">1</a>The earth is the Lord’s, and all its fullness,
        The world and those who dwell therein.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-2.htm">2</a>For He has founded it upon the seas,
        And established it upon the waters.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-3.htm">3</a>Who may ascend into the hill of the Lord?
        Or who may stand in His holy place?</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm">4</a>He who has clean hands and a pure heart,
Who has not lifted up his soul to an idol,
Nor sworn deceitfully.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-5.htm">5</a>He shall receive blessing from the Lord,
        And righteousness from the God of his salvation.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-6.htm">6</a>This is Jacob, the generation of those who seek Him,
        Who seek Your face. Selah</p>
        <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-1.htm">1</a>Lift up your heads, O you gates!
            And be lifted up, you everlasting doors!
            And the King of glory shall come in.</p>
        <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-2.htm">2</a>Who is this King of glory?
            The Lord strong and mighty,
            The Lord mighty in battle.</p>
        <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-3.htm">3</a>Lift up your heads, O you gates!
            Lift up, you everlasting doors!
            And the King of glory shall come in.</p>
        <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm">4</a>Who is this King of glory?
            The Lord of hosts,
            He is the King of glory. Selah</p>
