<h2> Psalms 115 </h2>

<h4> The Futility of Idols and the Trustworthiness of God  </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-1.htm" target="_blsnk"></a>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us,But to Your name give glory,Because of Your mercy,Because of Your truth.
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Why should the Gentiles say,"So where is their God?"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>But our God is in heaven;He does whatever He pleases.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Their idols are silver and gold,The work of men's hands.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>They have mouths, but they do not speak;Eyes they have, but they do not see;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>They have ears, but they do not hear;Noses they have, but they do not smell;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>They have hands, but they do not handle;Feet they have, but they do not walk;Nor do they mutter through their throat.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Those who make them are like them;So is everyone who trusts in them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>O Israel, trust in the Lord;He is their help and their shield.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>O house of Aaron, trust in the Lord;He is their help and their shield.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>You who fear the Lord, trust in the Lord;He is their help and their shield.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>The Lord has been mindful of us;He will bless us;He will bless the house of Israel;He will bless the house of Aaron.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>He will bless those who fear the Lord,Both small and great.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>May the Lord give you increase more and more,You and your children.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>May you be blessed by the Lord,Who made heaven and earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord's;But the earth He has given to the children of men.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>The dead do not praise the Lord,Nor any who go down into silence.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>But we will bless the Lord From this time forth and forevermore.Praise the Lord!</p>
