<h2>Psalms 64  </h2>

<h4>  Oppressed by the Wicked but Rejoicing in the Lord </h4>
<h4> To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.  </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Hear my voice, O God, in my meditation;Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Hide me from the secret plots of the wicked,From the rebellion of the workers of iniquity,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Who sharpen their tongue like a sword,And bend their bows to shoot their arrows—bitter words,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>That they may shoot in secret at the blameless;Suddenly they shoot at him and do not fear.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>They encourage themselves in an evil matter;They talk of laying snares secretly;They say, “Who will see them?”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>They devise iniquities:“We have perfected a shrewd scheme.”Both the inward thought and the heart of man are deep.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>But God shall shoot at them with an arrow;Suddenly they shall be wounded.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>So He will make them stumble over their own tongue;All who see them shall flee away.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>All men shall fear,And shall declare the work of God;For they shall wisely consider His doing.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/64-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>The righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and trust in Him.And all the upright in heart shall glory.</p>
