<h2>Psalms 48  </h2>

<h4> The Glory of God in Zion  </h4>
<h5> A Song. A Psalm of the sons of Korah.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praisedIn the city of our God,In His holy mountain.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Beautiful in elevation,The joy of the whole earth,Is Mount Zion on the sides of the north,The city of the great King.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>God is in her palaces;He is known as her refuge.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>For behold, the kings assembled,They passed by together.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>They saw it, and so they marveled;They were troubled, they hastened away.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Fear took hold of them there,And pain, as of a woman in birth pangs,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>As when You break the ships of TarshishWith an east wind.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>As we have heard,So we have seenIn the city of the Lord of hosts,In the city of our God:God will establish it forever. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>We have thought, O God, on Your lovingkindness,In the midst of Your temple.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>According to Your name, O God,So is Your praise to the ends of the earth;Your right hand is full of righteousness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Let Mount Zion rejoice,Let the daughters of Judah be glad,Because of Your judgments.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Walk about Zion,And go all around her.Count her towers;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Mark well her bulwarks;Consider her palaces;That you may tell it to the generation following.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>For this is God,Our God forever and ever;He will be our guideEven to death.</p>
