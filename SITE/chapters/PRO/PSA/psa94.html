<h2>Psalms 94 </h2>

<h4>  God the Refuge of the Righteous </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongs—O God, to whom vengeance belongs, shine forth!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Rise up, O Judge of the earth;Render punishment to the proud.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Lord, how long will the wicked,How long will the wicked triumph?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>They utter speech, and speak insolent things;All the workers of iniquity boast in themselves.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>They break in pieces Your people, O Lord,And afflict Your heritage.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>They slay the widow and the stranger,And murder the fatherless.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Yet they say, “The Lord does not see,Nor does the God of Jacob understand.”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Understand, you senseless among the people;And you fools, when will you be wise?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>He who planted the ear, shall He not hear?He who formed the eye, shall He not see?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>He who instructs the nations, shall He not correct,He who teaches man knowledge?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>The Lord knows the thoughts of man,That they are futile.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Blessed is the man whom You instruct, O Lord,And teach out of Your law,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>That You may give him rest from the days of adversity,Until the pit is dug for the wicked.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>For the Lord will not cast off His people,Nor will He forsake His inheritance.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>But judgment will return to righteousness,And all the upright in heart will follow it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Who will rise up for me against the evildoers?Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Unless the Lord had been my help,My soul would soon have settled in silence.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>If I say, “My foot slips,”Your mercy, O Lord, will hold me up.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>In the multitude of my anxieties within me,Your comforts delight my soul.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Shall the throne of iniquity, which devises evil by law,Have fellowship with You?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>They gather together against the life of the righteous,And condemn innocent blood.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>But the Lord has been my defense,And my God the rock of my refuge.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>He has brought on them their own iniquity,And shall cut them off in their own wickedness;The Lord our God shall cut them off.</p>
