Psalms 1

<h4>
The Way of the Righteous and the End of the Ungodly
</h4>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">1</a>
Blessed is the man
Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly,
Nor stands in the path of sinners,
Nor sits in the seat of the scornful;</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-2.htm">2</a>But his delight is in the law of the Lord,
    And in His law he meditates day and night.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-3.htm">3</a>He shall be like a tree
    Planted by the rivers of water,
    That brings forth its fruit in its season,
    Whose leaf also shall not wither;
    And whatever he does shall prosper.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-4.htm">4</a>The ungodly are not so,
    But are like the chaff which the wind drives away.</p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-5.htm">5</a>Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment,
    Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
    </p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-6.htm">6</a>For the Lord knows the way of the righteous,
    But the way of the ungodly shall perish.</p>
</p>
