<h2>Psalms 45  </h2>

<h4> The Glories of the Messiah and His Bride  </h4>
<h5>To the Chief Musician. Set to “The Lilies.” A Contemplation of the sons of Korah. A Song of Love.   </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-1.htm">1</a>My heart is overflowing with a good theme;I recite my composition concerning the King;My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-2.htm">2</a>You are fairer than the sons of men;Grace is poured upon Your lips;Therefore God has blessed You forever.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-3.htm">3</a>Gird Your sword upon Your thigh, O Mighty One,With Your glory and Your majesty.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-4.htm">4</a>And in Your majesty ride prosperously because of truth, humility, and righteousness;And Your right hand shall teach You awesome things.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-5.htm">5</a>Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the King’s enemies;The peoples fall under You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-6.htm">6</a>Your throne, O God, is forever and ever;A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your kingdom.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-7.htm">7</a>You love righteousness and hate wickedness;Therefore God, Your God, has anointed YouWith the oil of gladness more than Your companions.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-8.htm">8</a>All Your garments are scented with myrrh and aloes and cassia,Out of the ivory palaces, by which they have made You glad.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-9.htm">9</a>Kings’ daughters are among Your honorable women;At Your right hand stands the queen in gold from Ophir.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-10.htm">10</a>Listen, O daughter,Consider and incline your ear;Forget your own people also, and your father’s house;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-11.htm">11</a>So the King will greatly desire your beauty;Because He is your Lord, worship Him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-12.htm">12</a>And the daughter of Tyre will come with a gift;The rich among the people will seek your favor.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-13.htm">13</a>The royal daughter is all glorious within the palace;Her clothing is woven with gold.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-14.htm">14</a>She shall be brought to the King in robes of many colors;The virgins, her companions who follow her, shall be brought to You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-15.htm">15</a>With gladness and rejoicing they shall be brought;They shall enter the King’s palace.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-16.htm">16</a>Instead of Your fathers shall be Your sons,Whom You shall make princes in all the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-17.htm">17</a>I will make Your name to be remembered in all generations;Therefore the people shall praise You forever and ever.</p>
