<h2>Psalms 104  </h2>

<h4>  Praise to the Sovereign Lord for His Creation and Providence </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Bless the Lord, O my soul!O Lord my God, You are very great:You are clothed with honor and majesty,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Who cover Yourself with light as with a garment,Who stretch out the heavens like a curtain.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>He lays the beams of His upper chambers in the waters,Who makes the clouds His chariot,Who walks on the wings of the wind,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Who makes His angels spirits,His ministers a flame of fire.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>You who laid the foundations of the earth,So that it should not be moved forever,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>You covered it with the deep as with a garment;The waters stood above the mountains.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>At Your rebuke they fled;At the voice of Your thunder they hastened away.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>They went up over the mountains;They went down into the valleys,To the place which You founded for them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>You have set a boundary that they may not pass over,That they may not return to cover the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>He sends the springs into the valleys;They flow among the hills.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>They give drink to every beast of the field;The wild donkeys quench their thirst.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>By them the birds of the heavens have their home;They sing among the branches.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>He waters the hills from His upper chambers;The earth is satisfied with the fruit of Your works.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>He causes the grass to grow for the cattle,And vegetation for the service of man,That he may bring forth food from the earth,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>And wine that makes glad the heart of man,Oil to make his face shine,And bread which strengthens man's heart.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>The trees of the Lord are full of sap,The cedars of Lebanon which He planted,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Where the birds make their nests;The stork has her home in the fir trees.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>The high hills are for the wild goats;The cliffs are a refuge for the rock badgers.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>He appointed the moon for seasons;The sun knows its going down.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>You make darkness, and it is night,In which all the beasts of the forest creep about.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>The young lions roar after their prey,And seek their food from God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>When the sun rises, they gather together And lie down in their dens.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Man goes out to his work And to his labor until the evening.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>O Lord, how manifold are Your works!In wisdom You have made them all.The earth is full of Your possessions"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>This great and wide sea,In which are innumerable teeming things,Living things both small and great.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>There the ships sail about;There is that Leviathan Which You have made to play there.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>These all wait for You,That You may give them their food in due season.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>What You give them they gather in;You open Your hand, they are filled with good.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-28.htm" target="_blank">29</a>You hide Your face, they are troubled;You take away their breath, they die and return to their dust.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>You send forth Your Spirit, they are created;And You renew the face of the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>May the glory of the Lord endure forever;May the Lord rejoice in His works.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>He looks on the earth, and it trembles;He touches the hills, and they smoke.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>I will sing to the Lord as long as I live;I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>May my meditation be sweet to Him;I will be glad in the Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a>May sinners be consumed from the earth,And the wicked be no more.Bless the Lord, O my soul!Praise the Lord!</p>4
