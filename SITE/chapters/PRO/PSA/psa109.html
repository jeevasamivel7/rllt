<h2> Psalms 109 </h2>

<h4>  Plea for Judgment of False Accusers </h4>
<h5> To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Do not keep silent,O God of my praise!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful Have opened against me;They have spoken against me with a lying tongue.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>They have also surrounded me with words of hatred,And fought against me without a cause.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>In return for my love they are my accusers,But I give myself to prayer.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Thus they have rewarded me evil for good,And hatred for my love.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Set a wicked man over him,And let an accuser stand at his right hand.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>When he is judged, let him be found guilty,And let his prayer become sin.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Let his days be few,And let another take his office.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Let his children be fatherless,And his wife a widow.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Let his children continually be vagabonds, and beg;Let them seek their bread also from their desolate places.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Let the creditor seize all that he has,And let strangers plunder his labor.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Let there be none to extend mercy to him,Nor let there be any to favor his fatherless children.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Let his posterity be cut off,And in the generation following let their name be blotted out.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the Lord,And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Let them be continually before the Lord,That He may cut off the memory of them from the earth;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Because he did not remember to show mercy,But persecuted the poor and needy man,That he might even slay the broken in heart.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>As he loved cursing, so let it come to him;As he did not delight in blessing, so let it be far from him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>As he clothed himself with cursing as with his garment,So let it enter his body like water,And like oil into his bones.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Let it be to him like the garment which covers him,And for a belt with which he girds himself continually.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Let this be the Lord's reward to my accusers,And to those who speak evil against my person.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>But You, O God the Lord,Deal with me for Your name's sake;Because Your mercy is good, deliver me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>For I am poor and needy,And my heart is wounded within me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>I am gone like a shadow when it lengthens;I am shaken off like a locust.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>My knees are weak through fasting,And my flesh is feeble from lack of fatness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>I also have become a reproach to them;When they look at me, they shake their heads.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>Help me, O Lord my God!Oh, save me according to Your mercy,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>That they may know that this is Your hand-That You, Lord, have done it!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>Let them curse, but You bless;When they arise, let them be ashamed,But let Your servant rejoice.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-28.htm" target="_blank">29</a>Let my accusers be clothed with shame,And let them cover themselves with their own disgrace as with a mantle.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>I will greatly praise the Lord with my mouth;Yes, I will praise Him among the multitude.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>For He shall stand at the right hand of the poor,To save him from those who condemn him.</p>
