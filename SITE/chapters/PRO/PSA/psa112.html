<h2> Psalms 112 </h2>

<h4> The Blessed State of the Righteous  </h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Praise the Lord!Blessed is the man who fears the Lord,Who delights greatly in His commandments.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>His descendants will be mighty on earth;The generation of the upright will be blessed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Wealth and riches will be in his house,And his righteousness endures forever.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Unto the upright there arises light in the darkness;He is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>A good man deals graciously and lends;He will guide his affairs with discretion.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Surely he will never be shaken;The righteous will be in everlasting remembrance.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>He will not be afraid of evil tidings;His heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>His heart is established;He will not be afraid,Until he sees his desire upon his enemies.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>He has dispersed abroad,He has given to the poor;His righteousness endures forever;His horn will be exalted with honor.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>The wicked will see it and be grieved;He will gnash his teeth and melt away;The desire of the wicked shall perish.</p>
