<h2>psalms 5</h2>

<h4>A Prayer for Guidance
To the Chief Musician. With flutes. A Psalm of David.</h4>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-1.htm">1</a>Give ear to my words, O Lord,Consider my meditation.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-2.htm">2</a>Give heed to the voice of my cry,My King and my God,For to You I will pray.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-3.htm">3</a>My voice You shall hear in the morning, O Lord;In the morning I will direct it to You,And I will look up.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-4.htm">4</a>For You are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness,Nor shall evil dwell with You.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-5.htm">5</a>The boastful shall not stand in Your sight;You hate all workers of iniquity.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-6.htm">6</a>You shall destroy those who speak falsehood;The Lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-7.htm">7</a>But as for me, I will come into Your house in the multitude of Your mercy;In fear of You I will worship towardYour holy temple.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-8.htm">8</a>Lead me, O Lord, in Your righteousness because of my enemies;Make Your way straight before my face.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-9.htm">9</a>For there is no faithfulness in their mouth;Their inward part is destruction;Their throat is an open tomb;They flatter with their tongue.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-10.htm">10</a>Pronounce them guilty, O God!Let them fall by their own counsels;Cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions,For they have rebelled against You.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-11.htm">11</a>But let all those rejoice who put their trust in You;Let them ever shout for joy, because You defend them;Let those also who love Your nameBe joyful in You.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-12.htm">12</a>For You, O Lord, will bless the righteous;With favor You will surround him as with a shield.</p>
