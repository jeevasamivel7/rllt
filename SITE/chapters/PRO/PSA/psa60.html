<h2>Psalms 60  </h2>

<h4>Urgent Prayer for the Restored Favor of God   </h4>
<h5> To the Chief Musician. Set to “Lily of the Testimony.” A Michtam of David. For teaching. When he fought against Mesopotamia and Syria of Zobah, and Joab returned and killed twelve thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>O God, You have cast us off;You have broken us down;You have been displeased;Oh, restore us again!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>You have made the earth tremble;You have broken it;Heal its breaches, for it is shaking.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-3.htm" target="_blank">3/a>You have shown Your people hard things;You have made us drink the wine of confusion.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>You have given a banner to those who fear You,That it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>That Your beloved may be delivered,Save with Your right hand, and hear me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>God has spoken in His holiness:“I will rejoice;I will divide ShechemAnd measure out the Valley of Succoth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine;Ephraim also is the helmet for My head;Judah is My lawgiver.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Moab is My washpot;Over Edom I will cast My shoe;Philistia, shout in triumph because of Me.”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Who will bring me to the strong city?Who will lead me to Edom?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Is it not You, O God, who cast us off?And You, O God, who did not go out with our armies?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Give us help from trouble,For the help of man is useless.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Through God we will do valiantly,For it is He who shall tread down our enemies.</p>
