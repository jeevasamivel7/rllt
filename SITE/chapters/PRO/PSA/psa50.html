<h2> Psalms 50 </h2>

<h4> God the Righteous Judge  </h4>
<h5> A Psalm of Asaph.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>The Mighty One, God the Lord,Has spoken and called the earthFrom the rising of the sun to its going down.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty,God will shine forth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Our God shall come, and shall not keep silent;A fire shall devour before Him,And it shall be very tempestuous all around Him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>He shall call to the heavens from above,And to the earth, that He may judge His people:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>“Gather My saints together to Me,Those who have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice.”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Let the heavens declare His righteousness,For God Himself is Judge. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>“Hear, O My people, and I will speak,O Israel, and I will testify against you;I am God, your God!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>I will not rebuke you for your sacrificesOr your burnt offerings,Which are continually before Me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>I will not take a bull from your house,Nor goats out of your folds.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>For every beast of the forest is Mine,And the cattle on a thousand hills.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>I know all the birds of the mountains,And the wild beasts of the field are Mine.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>“If I were hungry, I would not tell you;For the world is Mine, and all its fullness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Will I eat the flesh of bulls,Or drink the blood of goats?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Offer to God thanksgiving,And pay your vows to the Most High.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Call upon Me in the day of trouble;I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me.”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>But to the wicked God says:“What right have you to declare My statutes,Or take My covenant in your mouth,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Seeing you hate instructionAnd cast My words behind you?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>When you saw a thief, you consented with him,And have been a partaker with adulterers.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>You give your mouth to evil,And your tongue frames deceit.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>You sit and speak against your brother;You slander your own mother’s son.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>These things you have done, and I kept silent;You thought that I was altogether like you;But I will rebuke you,And set them in order before your eyes.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>“Now consider this, you who forget God,Lest I tear you in pieces,And there be none to deliver:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Whoever offers praise glorifies Me;And to him who orders his conduct arightI will show the salvation of God.”</p>
