<h2> Psalms 81 </h2>

<h4> An Appeal for Israel’s Repentance  </h4>
<h5> To the Chief Musician. On an instrument of Gath. A Psalm of Asaph.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Sing aloud to God our strength;Make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Raise a song and strike the timbrel,The pleasant harp with the lute.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Blow the trumpet at the time of the New Moon,At the full moon, on our solemn feast day.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>For this is a statute for Israel,A law of the God of Jacob.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>This He established in Joseph as a testimony,When He went throughout the land of Egypt,Where I heard a language I did not understand.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>“I removed his shoulder from the burden;His hands were freed from the baskets.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>You called in trouble, and I delivered you;I answered you in the secret place of thunder;I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>“Hear, O My people, and I will admonish you!O Israel, if you will listen to Me!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>There shall be no foreign god among you;Nor shall you worship any foreign god.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>I am the Lord your God,Who brought you out of the land of Egypt;Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>“But My people would not heed My voice,And Israel would have none of Me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>So I gave them over to their own stubborn heart,To walk in their own counsels.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>“Oh, that My people would listen to Me,That Israel would walk in My ways!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>I would soon subdue their enemies,And turn My hand against their adversaries.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>The haters of the Lord would pretend submission to Him,But their fate would endure forever.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>He would have fed them also with the finest of wheat;And with honey from the rock I would have satisfied you.”</p>
