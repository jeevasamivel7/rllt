<h2>PSALM 6  </h2>

<h4>A Prayer of Faith in Time of Distress
To the Chief Musician. With stringed instruments. On an eight-stringed harp. A Psalm of David.</h4>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-1.htm">1</a>O Lord, do not rebuke me in Your anger,Nor chasten me in Your hot displeasure.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-2.htm">2</a>Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am weak;O Lord, heal me, for my bones are troubled.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-3.htm">3</a>My soul also is greatly troubled;But You, O Lord- how long?</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-4.htm">4</a>Return, O Lord, deliver me!Oh, save me for Your mercies' sake!</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-5.htm">5</a>For in death there is no remembrance of You;In the grave who will give You thanks?</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-6.htm">6</a>I am weary with my groaning;All night I make my bed swim;I drench my couch with my tears.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-7.htm">7</a>My eye wastes away because of grief;It grows old because of all my enemies.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-8.htm">8</a>Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity;For the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-9.htm">9</a>The Lord has heard my supplication;The Lord will receive my prayer.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-10.htm">10</a>Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly troubled;Let them turn back and be ashamed suddenly.</p>
