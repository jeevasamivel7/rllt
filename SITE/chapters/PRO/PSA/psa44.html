<h2>Psalms 44  </h2>

<h4> Redemption Remembered in Present Dishonor  </h4>
<h5>  To the Chief Musician. A Contemplation of the sons of Korah. </h5>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-1.htm">1</a>We have heard with our ears, O God,Our fathers have told us,The deeds You did in their days,In days of old:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-2.htm">2</a>You drove out the nations with Your hand,But them You planted;You afflicted the peoples, and cast them out.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-3.htm">3</a>For they did not gain possession of the land by their own sword,Nor did their own arm save them;But it was Your right hand, Your arm, and the light of Your countenance,Because You favored them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-4.htm">4</a>You are my King, O God;Command victories for Jacob.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-5.htm">5</a>Through You we will push down our enemies;Through Your name we will trample those who rise up against us.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-6.htm">6</a>For I will not trust in my bow,Nor shall my sword save me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-7.htm">7</a>But You have saved us from our enemies,And have put to shame those who hated us.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-8.htm">8</a>In God we boast all day long,And praise Your name forever. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-9.htm">9</a>But You have cast us off and put us to shame,And You do not go out with our armies.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-10.htm">10</a>You make us turn back from the enemy,And those who hate us have taken spoil for themselves.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-11.htm">11</a>You have given us up like sheep intended for food,And have scattered us among the nations.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-12.htm">12</a>You sell Your people for next to nothing,And are not enriched by selling them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-13.htm">13</a>You make us a reproach to our neighbors,A scorn and a derision to those all around us.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-14.htm">14</a>You make us a byword among the nations,A shaking of the head among the peoples.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-15.htm">15</a>My dishonor is continually before me,And the shame of my face has covered me,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-16.htm">16</a>Because of the voice of him who reproaches and reviles,Because of the enemy and the avenger.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-17.htm">17</a>All this has come upon us;But we have not forgotten You,Nor have we dealt falsely with Your covenant.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-18.htm">18/a>Our heart has not turned back,Nor have our steps departed from Your way;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-19.htm">19</a>But You have severely broken us in the place of jackals,And covered us with the shadow of death.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-20.htm">20</a>If we had forgotten the name of our God,Or stretched out our hands to a foreign god,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-21.htm">21</a>Would not God search this out?For He knows the secrets of the heart.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-22.htm">22</a>Yet for Your sake we are killed all day long;We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-23.htm">23</a>Awake! Why do You sleep, O Lord?Arise! Do not cast us off forever.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-24.htm">24</a>Why do You hide Your face,And forget our affliction and our oppression?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-25.htm">25</a>For our soul is bowed down to the dust;Our body clings to the ground.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-26.htm">26</a>Arise for our help,And redeem us for Your mercies" sake.</p>
