<h2> Psalms 147 </h2>

<h4> Praise to God for His Word and Providence  </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Praise the Lord!For it is good to sing praises to our God;For it is pleasant, and praise is beautiful.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>The Lord builds up Jerusalem;He gathers together the outcasts of Israel.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>He heals the brokenhearted And binds up their wounds.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>He counts the number of the stars;He calls them all by name.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Great is our Lord, and mighty in power;His understanding is infinite.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>The Lord lifts up the humble;He casts the wicked down to the ground.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Sing to the Lord with thanksgiving;Sing praises on the harp to our God,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Who covers the heavens with clouds,Who prepares rain for the earth,Who makes grass to grow on the mountains.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>He gives to the beast its food,And to the young ravens that cry.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>He does not delight in the strength of the horse;He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>The Lord takes pleasure in those who fear Him,In those who hope in His mercy.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem!Praise your God, O Zion!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>For He has strengthened the bars of your gates;He has blessed your children within you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>He makes peace in your borders,And fills you with the finest wheat.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>He sends out His command to the earth;His word runs very swiftly.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>He gives snow like wool;He scatters the frost like ashes;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>He casts out His hail like morsels;Who can stand before His cold?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>He sends out His word and melts them;He causes His wind to blow, and the waters flow.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>He declares His word to Jacob,His statutes and His judgments to Israel.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>He has not dealt thus with any nation;And as for His judgments, they have not known them.Praise the Lord!</p>
