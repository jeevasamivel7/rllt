<h2> Psalms 21 </h2>

<h4>  Joy in the Salvation of the Lord </h4>
<h5>   To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.</h5>




<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-1.htm">1</a>The king shall have joy in Your strength, O Lord;And in Your salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-2.htm">2</a>You have given him his heart's desire,And have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-3.htm">3</a>For You meet him with the blessings of goodness;You set a crown of pure gold upon his head.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-4.htm">4</a>He asked life from You, and You gave it to him'Length of days forever and ever.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-5.htm">5</a>His glory is great in Your salvation;Honor and majesty You have placed upon him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-6.htm">6</a>For You have made him most blessed forever;You have made him exceedingly glad with Your presence.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-7.htm">7</a>For the king trusts in the Lord,And through the mercy of the Most High he shall not be moved.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-8.htm">8</a>Your hand will find all Your enemies;Your right hand will find those who hate You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-9.htm">9</a>You shall make them as a fiery oven in the time of Your anger;The Lord shall swallow them up in His wrath,And the fire shall devour them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-10.htm">10</a>Their offspring You shall destroy from the earth,And their descendants from among the sons of men.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-11.htm">11</a>For they intended evil against You;They devised a plot which they are not able to perform.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-12.htm">12</a>Therefore You will make them turn their back;You will make ready Your arrows on Your string toward their faces.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-13.htm">13</a>Be exalted, O Lord, in Your own strength!We will sing and praise Your power.</p>
