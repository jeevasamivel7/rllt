<h2> Job 8 </h2>


<h4>Bildad: Job Should Repent</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>“How long will you speak these things,And the words of your mouth be like a strong wind?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Does God subvert judgment?Or does the Almighty pervert justice?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>If your sons have sinned against Him,He has cast them away for their transgression.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>If you would earnestly seek GodAnd make your supplication to the Almighty,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>If you were pure and upright,Surely now He would awake for you,And prosper your rightful dwelling place.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Though your beginning was small,Yet your latter end would increase abundantly.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>“For inquire, please, of the former age,And consider the things discovered by their fathers;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>For we were born yesterday, and know nothing,Because our days on earth are a shadow.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Will they not teach you and tell you,And utter words from their heart?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>“Can the papyrus grow up without a marsh?Can the reeds flourish without water?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>While it is yet green and not cut down,It withers before any other plant.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>So are the paths of all who forget God;And the hope of the hypocrite shall perish,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Whose confidence shall be cut off,And whose trust is a spider’s web.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>He leans on his house, but it does not stand.He holds it fast, but it does not endure.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>He grows green in the sun,And his branches spread out in his garden.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>His roots wrap around the rock heap,And look for a place in the stones.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>If he is destroyed from his place,Then it will deny him, saying, ‘I have not seen you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>“Behold, this is the joy of His way,And out of the earth others will grow.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Behold, God will not cast away the blameless,Nor will He uphold the evildoers.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>He will yet fill your mouth with laughing,And your lips with rejoicing.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Those who hate you will be clothed with shame,And the dwelling place of the wicked will come to nothing.”</p>
