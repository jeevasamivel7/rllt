<h2> Psalms 107 </h2>

<h4>  Thanksgiving to the Lord for His Great Works of Deliverance </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good!For His mercy endures forever.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Let the redeemed of the Lord say so,Whom He has redeemed from the hand of the enemy,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>And gathered out of the lands,From the east and from the west,From the north and from the south.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>They wandered in the wilderness in a desolate way;They found no city to dwell in.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Hungry and thirsty,Their soul fainted in them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble,And He delivered them out of their distresses.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>And He led them forth by the right way,That they might go to a city for a dwelling place.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Oh, that men would give thanks to the Lord for His goodness,And for His wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>For He satisfies the longing soul,And fills the hungry soul with goodness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Those who sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,Bound in affliction and irons-</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Because they rebelled against the words of God,And despised the counsel of the Most High,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Therefore He brought down their heart with labor;They fell down, and there was none to help.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble,And He saved them out of their distresses.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,And broke their chains in pieces.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Oh, that men would give thanks to the Lord for His goodness,And for His wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>For He has broken the gates of bronze,And cut the bars of iron in two.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Fools, because of their transgression,And because of their iniquities, were afflicted.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Their soul abhorred all manner of food,And they drew near to the gates of death.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble,And He saved them out of their distresses.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>He sent His word and healed them,And delivered them from their destructions.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Oh, that men would give thanks to the Lord for His goodness,And for His wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving,And declare His works with rejoicing.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Those who go down to the sea in ships,Who do business on great waters,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>They see the works of the Lord,And His wonders in the deep.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>For He commands and raises the stormy wind,Which lifts up the waves of the sea.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>They mount up to the heavens,They go down again to the depths;Their soul melts because of trouble.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man,And are at their wits' end.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>Then they cry out to the Lord in their trouble,And He brings them out of their distresses.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-28.htm" target="_blank">29</a>He calms the storm,So that its waves are still.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>Then they are glad because they are quiet;So He guides them to their desired haven.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>Oh, that men would give thanks to the Lord for His goodness,And for His wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>Let them exalt Him also in the assembly of the people,And praise Him in the company of the elders.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>He turns rivers into a wilderness,And the watersprings into dry ground;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>A fruitful land into barrenness,For the wickedness of those who dwell in it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a>He turns a wilderness into pools of water,And dry land into watersprings.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-36.htm" target="_blank">36</a>There He makes the hungry dwell,That they may establish a city for a dwelling place,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-37.htm" target="_blank">37</a>And sow fields and plant vineyards,That they may yield a fruitful harvest.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-38.htm" target="_blank">38</a>He also blesses them, and they multiply greatly;And He does not let their cattle decrease.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-39.htm" target="_blank">39</a>When they are diminished and brought low Through oppression, affliction, and sorrow,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-40.htm" target="_blank">40</a>He pours contempt on princes,And causes them to wander in the wilderness where there is no way;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-41.htm" target="_blank">41</a>Yet He sets the poor on high, far from affliction,And makes their families like a flock.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-42.htm" target="_blank">42</a>The righteous see it and rejoice,And all iniquity stops its mouth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-43.htm" target="_blank">43</a>Whoever is wise will observe these things,And they will understand the lovingkindness of the Lord.</p>
