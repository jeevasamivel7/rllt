<h2>Psalms 84  </h2>

<h4>The Blessedness of Dwelling in the House of God   </h4>
<h5>  To the Chief Musician. On an instrument of Gath. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. </h5>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>How lovely is Your tabernacle,O Lord of hosts!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>My soul longs, yes, even faints For the courts of the Lord;My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Even the sparrow has found a home,And the swallow a nest for herself,Where she may lay her youngâ€”Even Your altars, O Lord of hosts,My King and my God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Blessed are those who dwell in Your house;They will still be praising You. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Blessed is the man whose strength is in You,Whose heart is set on pilgrimage.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>As they pass through the Valley of Baca,They make it a spring;The rain also covers it with pools.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>They go from strength to strength;Each one appears before God in Zion.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer;Give ear, O God of Jacob! Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>O God, behold our shield,And look upon the face of Your anointed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand.I would rather [g]be a doorkeeper in the house of my God Than dwell in the tents of wickedness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>For the Lord God is a sun and shield;The Lord will give grace and glory;No good thing will He withhold From those who walk uprightly.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>O Lord of hosts,Blessed is the man who trusts in You!</p>
