<h2> Psalms 8 </h2>

<h4>The Glory of the Lord in Creation
To the Chief Musician. On the instrument of Gath. A Psalm of David.</h4>



<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-1.htm">1</a>O Lord, our Lord,How excellent is Your name in all the earth,Who have set Your glory above the heavens!</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-2.htm">2</a>Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infantsYou have ordained strength,Because of Your enemies,That You may silence the enemy and the avenger.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-3.htm">3</a>When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers,The moon and the stars, which You have ordained,</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-4.htm">4</a>What is man that You are mindful of him,And the son of man that You visit him?</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-5.htm">5</a>For You have made him a little lower than the angels,And You have crowned him with glory and honor.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-6.htm">6</a>You have made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands;You have put all things under his feet,</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-7.htm">7</a>All sheep and oxen-Even the beasts of the field,</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-8.htm">8</a>The birds of the air,And the fish of the seaThat pass through the paths of the seas.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-9.htm">9</a>O Lord, our Lord,How excellent is Your name in all the earth!</p>
