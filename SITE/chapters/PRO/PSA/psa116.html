<h2>Psalms 116  </h2>

<h4> Thanksgiving for Deliverance from Death  </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>I love the Lord, because He has heard My voice and my supplications.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Because He has inclined His ear to me,Therefore I will call upon Him as long as I live.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>The pains of death surrounded me,And the pangs of Sheol laid hold of me;I found trouble and sorrow.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Then I called upon the name of the Lord:“O Lord, I implore You, deliver my soul!”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Gracious is the Lord, and righteous;Yes, our God is merciful.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>The Lord preserves the simple;I was brought low, and He saved me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Return to your rest, O my soul,For the Lord has dealt bountifully with you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>For You have delivered my soul from death,My eyes from tears,And my feet from falling.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>I will walk before the Lord In the land of the living.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>I believed, therefore I spoke,“I am greatly afflicted.”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>I said in my haste,“All men are liars.”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>What shall I render to the Lord For all His benefits toward me?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>I will take up the cup of salvation,And call upon the name of the Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>I will pay my vows to the Lord Now in the presence of all His people.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Precious in the sight of the Lord Is the death of His saints.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>O Lord, truly I am Your servant;I am Your servant, the son of Your maidservant;You have loosed my bonds.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>I will offer to You the sacrifice of thanksgiving,And will call upon the name of the Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>I will pay my vows to the Lord Now in the presence of all His people,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>In the courts of the Lord’s house,In the midst of you, O Jerusalem.Praise the Lord!</p>
