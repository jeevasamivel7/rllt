<h2>Psalms 40  </h2>

<h4> Faith Persevering in Trial  </h4>
<h5> To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.  </h5>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-1.htm">1</a>I waited patiently for the Lord;And He inclined to me,And heard my cry.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-2.htm">2</a>He also brought me up out of a horrible pit,Out of the miry clay,And set my feet upon a rock,And established my steps.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-3.htm">3</a>He has put a new song in my mouth'Praise to our God;Many will see it and fear,And will trust in the Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-4.htm">4</a>Blessed is that man who makes the Lord his trust,And does not respect the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-5.htm">5</a>Many, O Lord my God, are Your wonderful worksWhich You have done;And Your thoughts toward usCannot be recounted to You in order;If I would declare and speak of them,They are more than can be numbered.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-6.htm">6</a>Sacrifice and offering You did not desire;My ears You have opened.Burnt offering and sin offering You did not require.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-7.htm">7</a>Then I said, "Behold, I come;In the scroll of the book it is written of me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-8.htm">8</a>I delight to do Your will, O my God,And Your law is within my heart."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-9.htm">9</a>I have proclaimed the good news of righteousnessIn the great assembly;Indeed, I do not restrain my lips,O Lord, You Yourself know.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-10.htm">10</a>I have not hidden Your righteousness within my heart;I have declared Your faithfulness and Your salvation;I have not concealed Your lovingkindness and Your truthFrom the great assembly.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-11.htm">11</a>Do not withhold Your tender mercies from me, O Lord;Let Your lovingkindness and Your truth continually preserve me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-12.htm">12</a>For innumerable evils have surrounded me;My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up;They are more than the hairs of my head;Therefore my heart fails me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-13.htm">13</a>Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me;O Lord, make haste to help me!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-14.htm">14</a>Let them be ashamed and brought to mutual confusionWho seek to destroy my life;Let them be driven backward and brought to dishonorWho wish me evil.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-15.htm">15</a>Let them be confounded because of their shame,Who say to me, "Aha, aha!"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-16.htm">16</a>Let all those who seek You rejoice and be glad in You;Let such as love Your salvation say continually,"The Lord be magnified!"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-17.htm">17</a>But I am poor and needy;Yet the Lord thinks upon me.You are my help and my deliverer;Do not delay, O my God.</p>
