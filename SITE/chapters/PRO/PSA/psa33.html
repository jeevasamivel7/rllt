<h2>Psalms 33 </h2>

<h4> The Sovereignty of the Lord in Creation and History  </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-1.htm">1</a>Rejoice in the Lord, O you righteous!For praise from the upright is beautiful.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-2.htm">2</a>Praise the Lord with the harp;Make melody to Him with an instrument of ten strings.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-3.htm">3</a>Sing to Him a new song;Play skillfully with a shout of joy.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-4.htm">4</a>For the word of the Lord is right,And all His work is done in truth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-5.htm">5</a>He loves righteousness and justice;The earth is full of the goodness of the Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-6.htm">6</a>By the word of the Lord the heavens were made,And all the host of them by the breath of His mouth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-7.htm">7</a>He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap;He lays up the deep in storehouses.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-8.htm">8</a>Let all the earth fear the Lord;Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-9.htm">9</a>For He spoke, and it was done;He commanded, and it stood fast.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-10.htm">10</a>The Lord brings the counsel of the nations to nothing;He makes the plans of the peoples of no effect.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-11.htm">11</a>The counsel of the Lord stands forever,The plans of His heart to all generations.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-12.htm">12</a>Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord,The people He has chosen as His own inheritance.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-13.htm">13</a>The Lord looks from heaven;He sees all the sons of men.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-14.htm">14</a>From the place of His dwelling He looksOn all the inhabitants of the earth;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-15.htm">15</a>He fashions their hearts individually;He considers all their works.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-16.htm">16</a>No king is saved by the multitude of an army;A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-17.htm">17</a>A horse is a vain hope for safety;Neither shall it deliver any by its great strength.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-18.htm">18</a>Behold, the eye of the Lord is on those who fear Him,On those who hope in His mercy,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-19.htm">19</a>To deliver their soul from death,And to keep them alive in famine.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-20.htm">20</a>Our soul waits for the Lord;He is our help and our shield.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-21.htm">21</a>For our heart shall rejoice in Him,Because we have trusted in His holy name.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-22.htm">22</a>Let Your mercy, O Lord, be upon us,Just as we hope in You.</p>
