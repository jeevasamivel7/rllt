<h2> Psalms 75 </h2>

<h4>  Thanksgiving for God’s Righteous Judgment </h4>
<h5> To the Chief Musician. Set to “Do Not Destroy.” A Psalm of Asaph. A Song.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>We give thanks to You, O God, we give thanks!For Your wondrous works declare that Your name is near.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>“When I choose the proper time,I will judge uprightly.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>The earth and all its inhabitants are dissolved;I set up its pillars firmly. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>“I said to the boastful, ‘Do not deal boastfully,’And to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up the horn.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Do not lift up your horn on high;Do not speak with a stiff neck.’ ”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>For exaltation comes neither from the east Nor from the west nor from the south.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>But God is the Judge:He puts down one,And exalts another.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup,And the wine is red;It is fully mixed, and He pours it out;Surely its dregs shall all the wicked of the earth Drain and drink down.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>But I will declare forever,I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>“All the horns of the wicked I will also cut off,But the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.”</p>
