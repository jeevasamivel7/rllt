<h2> PSALM 4 </h2>

<h4>The Safety of the Faithful
To the Chief Musician. With stringed instruments. A Psalm of David.
1Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness!</h4>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-1.htm">1</a>You have relieved me in my distress;Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-2.htm">2</a>How long, O you sons of men,Will you turn my glory to shame?How long will you love worthlessness seek falsehood? Selah</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-3.htm">3</a>But know that the Lord has set apart for Himself him who is godly;The Lord will hear when I call to Him.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-4.htm">4</a>Be angry, and do not sin.Meditate within your heart on your bed, and be still. Selah</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-5.htm">5</a>Offer the sacrifices of righteousness,And put your trust in the Lord.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-6.htm">6</a>There are many who say,�Who will show us any good?�Lord, lift up the light of Your countenance upon us.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-7.htm">7</a>You have put gladness in my heart,More than in the season that their grain and wine increased.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-8.htm">8</a>I will both lie down in peace, and sleep;For You alone, O Lord, make me dwell in safety.</p>
