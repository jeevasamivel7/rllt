<h2> Psalms 125 </h2>

<h4> The Lord the Strength of His People  </h4>
<h5>A Song of Ascents. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Those who trust in the Lord Are like Mount Zion,Which cannot be moved, but abides forever.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>As the mountains surround Jerusalem,So the Lord surrounds His people From this time forth and forever.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest On the land allotted to the righteous,Lest the righteous reach out their hands to iniquity.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Do good, O Lord, to those who are good,And to those who are upright in their hearts.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>As for such as turn aside to their crooked ways,The Lord shall lead them away With the workers of iniquity.Peace be upon Israel!</p>
