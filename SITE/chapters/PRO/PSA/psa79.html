<h2> Psalms 79 </h2>

<h4> A Dirge and a Prayer for Israel, Destroyed by Enemies  </h4>
<h5> A Psalm of Asaph.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>O God, the nations have come into Your inheritance;Your holy temple they have defiled;They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>The dead bodies of Your servants They have given as food for the birds of the heavens,The flesh of Your saints to the beasts of the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Their blood they have shed like water all around Jerusalem,And there was no one to bury them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>We have become a reproach to our neighbors,A scorn and derision to those who are around us.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>How long, Lord?Will You be angry forever?Will Your jealousy burn like fire?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not know You,And on the kingdoms that do not call on Your name.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>For they have devoured Jacob,And laid waste his dwelling place.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Oh, do not remember former iniquities against us!Let Your tender mercies come speedily to meet us,For we have been brought very low.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Help us, O God of our salvation,For the glory of Your name;And deliver us, and provide atonement for our sins,For Your name’s sake!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Why should the nations say,“Where is their God?” Let there be known among the nations in our sight The avenging of the blood of Your servants which has been shed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Let the groaning of the prisoner come before You;According to the greatness of Your power Preserve those who are appointed to die;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>And return to our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom Their reproach with which they have reproached You, O Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>So we, Your people and sheep of Your pasture,Will give You thanks forever;We will show forth Your praise to all generations.</p>
