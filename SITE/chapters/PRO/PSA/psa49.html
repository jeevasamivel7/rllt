<h2>Psalms 49  </h2>

<h4> The Confidence of the Foolish  </h4>
<h5>  To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Hear this, all peoples;Give ear, all inhabitants of the world,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Both low and high,Rich and poor together.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>My mouth shall speak wisdom,And the meditation of my heart shall give understanding.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>I will incline my ear to a proverb;I will disclose my dark saying on the harp.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Why should I fear in the days of evil,When the iniquity at my heels surrounds me?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Those who trust in their wealthAnd boast in the multitude of their riches,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>None of them can by any means redeem his brother,Nor give to God a ransom for him—</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>For the redemption of their souls is costly,And it shall cease forever—</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>That he should continue to live eternally,And not see the Pit.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>For he sees wise men die;Likewise the fool and the senseless person perish,And leave their wealth to others.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Their inner thought is that their houses will last forever,Their dwelling places to all generations;They call their lands after their own names.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Nevertheless man, though in honor, does not remain;He is like the beasts that perish.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>This is the way of those who are foolish,And of their posterity who approve their sayings. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Like sheep they are laid in the grave;Death shall feed on them;The upright shall have dominion over them in the morning;And their beauty shall be consumed in the grave, far from their dwelling.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave,For He shall receive me. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Do not be afraid when one becomes rich,When the glory of his house is increased;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>For when he dies he shall carry nothing away;His glory shall not descend after him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Though while he lives he blesses himself(For men will praise you when you do well for yourself),</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>He shall go to the generation of his fathers;They shall never see light.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>A man who is in honor, yet does not understand,Is like the beasts that perish.</p>
