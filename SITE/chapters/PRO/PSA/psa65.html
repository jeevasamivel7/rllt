<h2> Psalms 65 </h2>

<h4>Praise to God for His Salvation and Providence   </h4>
<h5> To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. A Song.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Praise is awaiting You, O God, in Zion;And to You the vow shall be performed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>O You who hear prayer,To You all flesh will come.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Iniquities prevail against me;As for our transgressions,You will provide atonement for them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Blessed is the man You choose,And cause to approach You,That he may dwell in Your courts.We shall be satisfied with the goodness of Your house,Of Your holy temple.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>By awesome deeds in righteousness You will answer us,O God of our salvation,You who are the confidence of all the ends of the earth,And of the far-off seas;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Who established the mountains by His strength,Being clothed with power;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>You who still the noise of the seas,The noise of their waves,And the tumult of the peoples.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>They also who dwell in the farthest parts are afraid of Your signs;You make the outgoings of the morning and evening rejoice.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>You visit the earth and water it,You greatly enrich it;The river of God is full of water;You provide their grain,For so You have prepared it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>You water its ridges abundantly,You settle its furrows;You make it soft with showers,You bless its growth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>You crown the year with Your goodness,And Your paths drip with abundance.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>They drop on the pastures of the wilderness,And the little hills rejoice on every side.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>The pastures are clothed with flocks;The valleys also are covered with grain;They shout for joy, they also sing.</p>
