<h2> Psalms 36 </h2>

<h4> Man's Wickedness and God's Perfections  </h4>
<h5> To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David the servant of the Lord.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-1.htm">1</a>An oracle within my heart concerning the transgression of the wicked:There is no fear of God before his eyes.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-2.htm">2</a>For he flatters himself in his own eyes,When he finds out his iniquity and when he hates.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-3.htm">3</a>The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit;He has ceased to be wise and to do good.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-4.htm">4</a>He devises wickedness on his bed;He sets himself in a way that is not good;He does not abhor evil.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-5.htm">5</a>Your mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens;Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-6.htm">6</a>Your righteousness is like the great mountains;Your judgments are a great deep;O Lord, You preserve man and beast.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-7.htm">7</a>How precious is Your lovingkindness, O God!Therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of Your wings.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-8.htm">8</a>They are abundantly satisfied with the fullness of Your house,And You give them drink from the river of Your pleasures.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-9.htm">9</a>For with You is the fountain of life;In Your light we see light.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-10.htm">10</a>Oh, continue Your lovingkindness to those who know You,And Your righteousness to the upright in heart.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-11.htm">11</a>Let not the foot of pride come against me,And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-12.htm">12</a>There the workers of iniquity have fallen;They have been cast down and are not able to rise.</p>
