<h2> Psalms 35 </h2>

<h4> The Lord the Avenger of His People  </h4>
<h5>  A Psalm of David. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-1.htm">1</a>Plead my cause, O Lord, with those who strive with me;Fight against those who fight against me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-2.htm">2</a>Take hold of shield and buckler,And stand up for my help.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-3.htm">3</a>Also draw out the spear,And stop those who pursue me.Say to my soul,"I am your salvation."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-4.htm">4</a>Let those be put to shame and brought to dishonorWho seek after my life;Let those be turned back and brought to confusionWho plot my hurt.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-5.htm">5</a>Let them be like chaff before the wind,And let the angel of the Lord chase them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-6.htm">6</a>Let their way be dark and slippery,And let the angel of the Lord pursue them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-7.htm">7</a>For without cause they have hidden their net for me in a pit,Which they have dug without cause for my life.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-8.htm">8</a>Let destruction come upon him unexpectedly,And let his net that he has hidden catch himself;Into that very destruction let him fall.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-9.htm">9</a>And my soul shall be joyful in the Lord;It shall rejoice in His salvation.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-10.htm">10</a>All my bones shall say,"Lord, who is like You,Delivering the poor from him who is too strong for him,Yes, the poor and the needy from him who plunders him?"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-11.htm">11</a>Fierce witnesses rise up;They ask me things that I do not know.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-12.htm">12</a>They reward me evil for good,To the sorrow of my soul.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-13.htm">13</a>But as for me, when they were sick,My clothing was sackcloth;I humbled myself with fasting;And my prayer would return to my own heart.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-14.htm">14</a>I paced about as though he were my friend or brother;I bowed down heavily, as one who mourns for his mother.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-15.htm">15</a>But in my adversity they rejoicedAnd gathered together;Attackers gathered against me,And I did not know it;They tore at me and did not cease;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-16.htm">16</a>With ungodly mockers at feastsThey gnashed at me with their teeth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-17.htm">17</a>Lord, how long will You look on?Rescue me from their destructions,My precious life from the lions.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-18.htm">18</a>I will give You thanks in the great assembly;I will praise You among many people.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-19.htm">19</a>Let them not rejoice over me who are wrongfully my enemies;Nor let them wink with the eye who hate me without a cause.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-20.htm">20</a>For they do not speak peace,But they devise deceitful mattersAgainst the quiet ones in the land.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-21.htm">21</a>They also opened their mouth wide against me,And said, "Aha, aha!Our eyes have seen it."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-22.htm">22</a>This You have seen, O Lord;Do not keep silence.O Lord, do not be far from me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-23.htm">23</a>Stir up Yourself, and awake to my vindication,To my cause, my God and my Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-24.htm">24</a>Vindicate me, O Lord my God, according to Your righteousness;And let them not rejoice over me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-25.htm">25</a>Let them not say in their hearts, "Ah, so we would have it!"Let them not say, "We have swallowed him up."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-26.htm">26</a>Let them be ashamed and brought to mutual confusionWho rejoice at my hurt;Let them be clothed with shame and dishonorWho exalt themselves against me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-27.htm">27</a>Let them shout for joy and be glad,Who favor my righteous cause;And let them say continually,"Let the Lord be magnified,Who has pleasure in the prosperity of His servant."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-27.htm">28</a>And my tongue shall speak of Your righteousness And of Your praise all the day long.</p>
