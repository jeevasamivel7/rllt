<h2> Psalms 32  </h2>

<h4>The Joy of Forgiveness   </h4>
<h4> A Psalm of David. A Contemplation.  </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm">1</a>Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven,Whose sin is covered.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-2.htm">2</a>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord does not impute iniquity,And in whose spirit there is no deceit.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-3.htm">3</a>When I kept silent, my bones grew oldThrough my groaning all the day long.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-4.htm">4</a>For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me;My vitality was turned into the drought of summer. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-5.htm">5</a>I acknowledged my sin to You,And my iniquity I have not hidden.I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the Lord,"And You forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-6.htm">6</a>For this cause everyone who is godly shall pray to YouIn a time when You may be found;Surely in a flood of great watersThey shall not come near him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-7.htm">7</a>You are my hiding place;You shall preserve me from trouble;You shall surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-8.htm">8</a>I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go;I will guide you with My eye.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-9.htm">9</a>Do not be like the horse or like the mule,Which have no understanding,Which must be harnessed with bit and bridle,Else they will not come near you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-10.htm">10</a>Many sorrows shall be to the wicked;But he who trusts in the Lord, mercy shall surround him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-11.htm">11</a>Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, you righteous;And shout for joy, all you upright in heart!</p>
