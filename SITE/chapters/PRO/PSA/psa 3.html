<h2> PSALM 3 </h2>

<h4>A Psalm of David when he fled from Absalom his son.</h4>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-1.htm">1</a>Lord, how they have increased who trouble me!Many are they who rise up against me.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-2.htm">2</a>Many are they who say of me,There is no help for him in God. Selah</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-3.htm">3</a>But You, O Lord, are a shield [a]for me,My glory and the One who lifts up my head.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-4.htm">4</a>I cried to the Lord with my voice,And He heard me from His holy hill. Selah</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-5.htm">5</a>I lay down and slept;I awoke, for the Lord sustained me.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-6.htm">6</a>I will not be afraid of ten thousands of peopleWho have set themselves against me all around.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-7.htm">7</a>Arise, O Lord;Save me, O my God!For You have struck all my enemies on the cheekbone;You have broken the teeth of the ungodly.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-8.htm">8</a>Salvation belongs to the Lord.Your blessing is upon Your people. Selah</p>
