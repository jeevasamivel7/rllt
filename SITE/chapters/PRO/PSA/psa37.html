<h2> Psalms 37 </h2>

<h4> The Heritage of the Righteous and the Calamity of the Wicked  </h4>
<h5> A Psalm of David.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-1.htm">1</a>Do not fret because of evildoers,Nor be envious of the workers of iniquity.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-2.htm">2</a>For they shall soon be cut down like the grass,And wither as the green herb.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-3.htm">3</a>Trust in the Lord, and do good;Dwell in the land, and feed on His faithfulness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-4.htm">4</a>Delight yourself also in the Lord,And He shall give you the desires of your heart.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-5.htm">5</a>Commit your way to the Lord,Trust also in Him,And He shall bring it to pass.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-6.htm">6</a>He shall bring forth your righteousness as the light,And your justice as the noonday.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-7.htm">7</a>Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him;Do not fret because of him who prospers in his way,Because of the man who brings wicked schemes to pass.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-8.htm">8</a>Cease from anger, and forsake wrath;Do not fret'it only causes harm.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-9.htm">9</a>For evildoers shall be cut off;But those who wait on the Lord,They shall inherit the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-10.htm">10</a>For yet a little while and the wicked shall be no more;Indeed, you will look carefully for his place,But it shall be no more.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-11.htm">11</a>But the meek shall inherit the earth,And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-12.htm">12</a>The wicked plots against the just,And gnashes at him with his teeth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-13.htm">13</a>The Lord laughs at him,For He sees that his day is coming.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-14.htm">14</a>The wicked have drawn the swordAnd have bent their bow,To cast down the poor and needy,To slay those who are of upright conduct.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-15.htm">15</a>Their sword shall enter their own heart,And their bows shall be broken.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-16.htm">16</a>A little that a righteous man hasIs better than the riches of many wicked.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-17.htm">17</a>For the arms of the wicked shall be broken,But the Lord upholds the righteous.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-18.htm">18</a>The Lord knows the days of the upright,And their inheritance shall be forever.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-19.htm">19</a>They shall not be ashamed in the evil time,And in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-20.htm">20</a>But the wicked shall perish;And the enemies of the Lord,Like the splendor of the meadows, shall vanish.Into smoke they shall vanish away.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-21.htm">21</a>The wicked borrows and does not repay,But the righteous shows mercy and gives.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-22.htm">22</a>For those blessed by Him shall inherit the earth,But those cursed by Him shall be cut off.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-23.htm">23</a>The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord,And He delights in his way.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-24.htm">24</a>Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down;For the Lord upholds him with His hand.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-25.htm">25</a>I have been young, and now am old;Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken,Nor his descendants begging bread.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-26.htm">26</a>He is ever merciful, and lends;And his descendants are blessed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-27.htm">27</a>Depart from evil, and do good;And dwell forevermore.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-28.htm">28</a>For the Lord loves justice,And does not forsake His saints;They are preserved forever,But the descendants of the wicked shall be cut off.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-29.htm">29</a>The righteous shall inherit the land,And dwell in it forever.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-30.htm">30</a>The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom,And his tongue talks of justice.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-31.htm">31</a>The law of his God is in his heart;None of his steps shall slide.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-32.htm">32</a>The wicked watches the righteous,And seeks to slay him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-33.htm">33</a>The Lord will not leave him in his hand,Nor condemn him when he is judged.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-34.htm">34</a>Wait on the Lord,And keep His way,And He shall exalt you to inherit the land;When the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-35.htm">35</a>I have seen the wicked in great power,And spreading himself like a native green tree.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-36.htm">36</a>Yet he passed away, and behold, he was no more;Indeed I sought him, but he could not be found.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-37.htm">37</a>Mark the blameless man, and observe the upright;For the future of that man is peace.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-38.htm">38</a>But the transgressors shall be destroyed together;The future of the wicked shall be cut off.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-39.htm">39</a>But the salvation of the righteous is from the Lord;He is their strength in the time of trouble.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-40.htm">40</a>And the Lord shall help them and deliver them;He shall deliver them from the wicked,And save them,Because they trust in Him.</p>
