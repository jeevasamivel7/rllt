<h2> Psalms 83 </h2>

<h4> Prayer to Frustrate Conspiracy Against Israel  </h4>
<h5> A Song. A Psalm of Asaph.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Do not keep silent, O God!Do not hold Your peace,And do not be still, O God!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>For behold, Your enemies make a tumult;And those who hate You have lifted up their head.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>They have taken crafty counsel against Your people,And consulted together against Your sheltered ones.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>They have said, “Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation,That the name of Israel may be remembered no more.”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>For they have consulted together with one consent;They form a confederacy against You:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites;Moab and the Hagrites;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek;Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Assyria also has joined with them;They have helped the children of Lot. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Deal with them as with Midian,As with Sisera,As with Jabin at the Brook Kishon,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Who perished at En Dor,Who became as refuse on the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Make their nobles like Oreb and like Zeeb,Yes, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Who said, “Let us take for ourselves The pastures of God for a possession.”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>O my God, make them like the whirling dust,Like the chaff before the wind!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>As the fire burns the woods,And as the flame sets the mountains on fire,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>So pursue them with Your tempest,And frighten them with Your storm.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Fill their faces with shame,That they may seek Your name, O Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Let them be confounded and dismayed forever;Yes, let them be put to shame and perish,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>That they may know that You, whose name alone is the Lord,Are the Most High over all the earth.</p>
