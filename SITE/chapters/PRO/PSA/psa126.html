<h2> Psalms 126 </h2>

<h4> A Joyful Return to Zion  </h4>
<h5> A Song of Ascents.  </h5>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/126-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>When the Lord brought back the captivity of Zion,We were like those who dream.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/126-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Then our mouth was filled with laughter,And our tongue with singing.Then they said among the nations,"The Lord has done great things for them."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/126-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>The Lord has done great things for us,And we are glad.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/126-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Bring back our captivity, O Lord,As the streams in the South.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/126-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Those who sow in tears Shall reap in joy.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/126-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>He who continually goes forth weeping,Bearing seed for sowing,Shall doubtless come again with rejoicing,Bringing his sheaves with him.</p>
