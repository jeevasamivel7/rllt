<h2> Psalms 69 </h2>

<h4>  An Urgent Plea for Help in TroubleTo the Chief Musician. Set to “The Lilies.” </h4>
<h5> A Psalm of David.  </h5>  

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Save me, O God!For the waters have come up to my neck. </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>I sink in deep mire,Where there is no standing;I have come into deep waters,Where the floods overflow me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>I am weary with my crying;My throat is dry;My eyes fail while I wait for my God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Those who hate me without a causeAre more than the hairs of my head;They are mighty who would destroy me, Being my enemies wrongfully;Though I have stolen nothing,I still must restore it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>O God, You know my foolishness;And my sins are not hidden from You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Let not those who wait for You, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed because of me;Let not those who seek You be confounded because of me, O God of Israel.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Because for Your sake I have borne reproach;Shame has covered my face.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>I have become a stranger to my brothers,And an alien to my mother’s children;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Because zeal for Your house has eaten me up,And the reproaches of those who reproach You have fallen on me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>When I wept and chastened my soul with fasting,That became my reproach.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>I also made sackcloth my garment;I became a byword to them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Those who sit in the gate speak against me,And I am the song of the drunkards.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>But as for me, my prayer is to You,O Lord, in the acceptable time;O God, in the multitude of Your mercy,Hear me in the truth of Your salvation.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Deliver me out of the mire,And let me not sink;Let me be delivered from those who hate me,And out of the deep waters.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Let not the floodwater overflow me,Nor let the deep swallow me up;And let not the pit shut its mouth on me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Hear me, O Lord, for Your lovingkindness is good;Turn to me according to the multitude of Your tender mercies.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>And do not hide Your face from Your servant,For I am in trouble;Hear me speedily.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Draw near to my soul, and redeem it;Deliver me because of my enemies.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>19You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor;My adversaries are all before You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Reproach has broken my heart,And I am full of heaviness;I looked for someone to take pity, but there was none;And for comforters, but I found none.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>They also gave me gall for my food,And for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Let their table become a snare before them,And their well-being a trap.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Let their eyes be darkened, so that they do not see;And make their loins shake continually.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>Pour out Your indignation upon them,And let Your wrathful anger take hold of them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Let their dwelling place be desolate;Let no one live in their tents.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>For they persecute the ones You have struck,And talk of the grief of those You have wounded.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>Add iniquity to their iniquity,And let them not come into Your righteousness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living,And not be written with the righteous.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>But I am poor and sorrowful;Let Your salvation, O God, set me up on high.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>I will praise the name of God with a song,And will magnify Him with thanksgiving.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>This also shall please the Lord better than an ox or bull,Which has horns and hooves.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>The humble shall see this and be glad;And you who seek God, your hearts shall live.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>For the Lord hears the poor,And does not despise His prisoners.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>Let heaven and earth praise Him,The seas and everything that moves in them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a>For God will save ZionAnd build the cities of Judah,That they may dwell there and possess it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-36.htm" target="_blank">36</a>Also, the descendants of His servants shall inherit it,And those who love His name shall dwell in it.</p>
