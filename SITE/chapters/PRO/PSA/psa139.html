<h2> Psalms 139 </h2>

<h4> God's Perfect Knowledge of Man  </h4>
<h5> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>O Lord, You have searched me and known me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>You know my sitting down and my rising up;You understand my thought afar off.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>You comprehend my path and my lying down,And are acquainted with all my ways.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>For there is not a word on my tongue,But behold, O Lord, You know it altogether.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>You have hedged me behind and before,And laid Your hand upon me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;It is high, I cannot attain it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Where can I go from Your Spirit?Or where can I flee from Your presence?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>If I ascend into heaven, You are there;If I make my bed in hell, behold, You are there.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>If I take the wings of the morning,And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Even there Your hand shall lead me,And Your right hand shall hold me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>If I say, "Surely the darkness shall fall on me,"Even the night shall be light about me;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Indeed, the darkness shall not hide from You,But the night shines as the day;The darkness and the light are both alike to You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>For You formed my inward parts;You covered me in my mother's womb.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made;Marvelous are Your works,And that my soul knows very well.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>My frame was not hidden from You,When I was made in secret,And skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Your eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed.And in Your book they all were written,The days fashioned for me,When as yet there were none of them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God!How great is the sum of them!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>If I should count them, they would be more in number than the sand;When I awake, I am still with You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Oh, that You would slay the wicked, O God!Depart from me, therefore, you bloodthirsty men.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>For they speak against You wickedly;Your enemies take Your name in vain.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Do I not hate them, O Lord, who hate You?And do I not loathe those who rise up against You?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>I hate them with perfect hatred;I count them my enemies.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Search me, O God, and know my heart;Try me, and know my anxieties;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>And see if there is any wicked way in me,And lead me in the way everlasting.</p>
