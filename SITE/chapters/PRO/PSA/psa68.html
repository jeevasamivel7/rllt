<h2>Psalms 68</h2>

<h4> The glory of God in His Goodness to Israel  </h4>
<h4>  To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. A Song. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Let God arise,Let His enemies be scattered;Let those also who hate Him flee before Him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>As smoke is driven away,So drive them away;As wax melts before the fire,So let the wicked perish at the presence of God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>But let the righteous be glad;Let them rejoice before God;Yes, let them rejoice exceedingly.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Sing to God, sing praises to His name;Extol Him who rides on the clouds,By His name Yah,And rejoice before Him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>A father of the fatherless, a defender of widows,Is God in His holy habitation.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>God sets the solitary in families;He brings out those who are bound into prosperity;But the rebellious dwell in a dry land.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>O God, when You went out before Your people,When You marched through the wilderness, Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>The earth shook;The heavens also dropped rain at the presence of God;Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>You, O God, sent a plentiful rain,Whereby You confirmed Your inheritance,When it was weary.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Your congregation dwelt in it;You, O God, provided from Your goodness for the poor.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>The Lord gave the word;Great was the company of those who proclaimed it:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>“Kings of armies flee, they flee,And she who remains at home divides the spoil.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Though you lie down among the sheepfolds,You will be like the wings of a dove covered with silver,And her feathers with yellow gold.”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>When the Almighty scattered kings in it,It was white as snow in Zalmon.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan;A mountain of many peaks is the mountain of Bashan.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Why do you fume with envy, you mountains of many peaks?This is the mountain which God desires to dwell in;Yes, the Lord will dwell in it forever.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>The chariots of God are twenty thousand,Even thousands of thousands;The Lord is among them as in Sinai, in the Holy Place.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>You have ascended on high,You have led captivity captive;You have received gifts among men,Even from the rebellious,That the Lord God might dwell there.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Blessed be the Lord,Who daily loads us with benefits,The God of our salvation! Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Our God is the God of salvation;And to God the Lord belong escapes from death.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>But God will wound the head of His enemies,The hairy scalp of the one who still goes on in his trespasses.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>The Lord said, “I will bring back from Bashan,I will bring them back from the depths of the sea,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>That your foot may crush them in blood,And the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from your enemies.”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>They have seen Your procession, O God,The procession of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after;Among them were the maidens playing timbrels.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>Bless God in the congregations,The Lord, from the fountain of Israel.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>There is little Benjamin, their leader,The princes of Judah and their company,The princes of Zebulun and the princes of Naphtali.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>Your God has commanded your strength;Strengthen, O God, what You have done for us.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>Because of Your temple at Jerusalem,Kings will bring presents to You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>Rebuke the beasts of the reeds,The herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples,Till everyone submits himself with pieces of silver.Scatter the peoples who delight in war.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>Envoys will come out of Egypt;Ethiopia will quickly stretch out her hands to God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth;Oh, sing praises to the Lord, Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>To Him who rides on the heaven of heavens, which were of old!Indeed, He sends out His voice, a mighty voice.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>Ascribe strength to God;His excellence is over Israel,And His strength is in the clouds.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a>O God, You are more awesome than Your holy places.The God of Israel is He who gives strength and power to His people.Blessed be God!</p>
