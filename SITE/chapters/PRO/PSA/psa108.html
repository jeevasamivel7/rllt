<h2> Psalms 108 </h2>

<h4> Assurance of God's Victory over Enemies  </h4>
<h5> A Song. A Psalm of David.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>O God, my heart is steadfast;I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Awake, lute and harp!I will awaken the dawn.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>I will praise You, O Lord, among the peoples,And I will sing praises to You among the nations.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>For Your mercy is great above the heavens,And Your truth reaches to the clouds.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Be exalted, O God, above the heavens,And Your glory above all the earth;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>That Your beloved may be delivered,Save with Your right hand, and hear me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>God has spoken in His holiness:"I will rejoice;I will divide Shechem And measure out the Valley of Succoth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Gilead is Mine; Manasseh is Mine;Ephraim also is the helmet for My head;Judah is My lawgiver.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Moab is My washpot;Over Edom I will cast My shoe;Over Philistia I will triumph."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Who will bring me into the strong city?Who will lead me to Edom?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Is it not You, O God, who cast us off?And You, O God, who did not go out with our armies?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Give us help from trouble,For the help of man is useless.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Through God we will do valiantly,For it is He who shall tread down our enemies.</p>
