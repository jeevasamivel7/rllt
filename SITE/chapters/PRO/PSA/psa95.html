<h2> Psalms 95 </h2>

<h4> A Call to Worship and Obedience  </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Oh come, let us sing to the Lord!Let us shout joyfully to the Rock of our salvation.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving;Let us shout joyfully to Him with psalms.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>For the Lord is the great God,And the great King above all gods.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>In His hand are the deep places of the earth;The heights of the hills are His also.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>The sea is His, for He made it;And His hands formed the dry land.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Oh come, let us worship and bow down;Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>For He is our God,And we are the people of His pasture,And the sheep of His hand.Today, if you will hear His voice:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>“Do not harden your hearts, as in the rebellion,As in the day of trial in the wilderness,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>When your fathers tested Me;They tried Me, though they saw My work.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>For forty years I was grieved with that generation,And said, ‘It is a people who go astray in their hearts,And they do not know My ways.’</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>So I swore in My wrath,‘They shall not enter My rest.’ ”</p>
