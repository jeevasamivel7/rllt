<h2> Psalms 144 </h2>

<h4>  A Song to the Lord Who Preserves and Prospers His People </h4>

<h5> A Psalm of David.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Blessed be the Lord my Rock,Who trains my hands for war,And my fingers for battle-</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>My lovingkindness and my fortress,My high tower and my deliverer,My shield and the One in whom I take refuge,Who subdues my people under me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Lord, what is man, that You take knowledge of him?Or the son of man, that You are mindful of him?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Man is like a breath;His days are like a passing shadow.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Bow down Your heavens, O Lord, and come down;Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Flash forth lightning and scatter them;Shoot out Your arrows and destroy them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Stretch out Your hand from above;Rescue me and deliver me out of great waters,From the hand of foreigners,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Whose mouth speaks lying words,And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>I will sing a new song to You, O God;On a harp of ten strings I will sing praises to You,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>The One who gives salvation to kings,Who delivers David His servant From the deadly sword.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Rescue me and deliver me from the hand of foreigners,Whose mouth speaks lying words,And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood-</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth;That our daughters may be as pillars,Sculptured in palace style;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>That our barns may be full,Supplying all kinds of produce;That our sheep may bring forth thousands And ten thousands in our fields;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>That our oxen may be well laden;That there be no breaking in or going out;That there be no outcry in our streets.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Happy are the people who are in such a state;Happy are the people whose God is the Lord!</p>
