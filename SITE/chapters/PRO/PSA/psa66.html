<h4> Praise to God for His Awesome Works  </h4>
<h5>  To the Chief Musician. A Song. A Psalm. </h5>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Make a joyful shout to God, all the earth!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Sing out the honor of His name;Make His praise glorious.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Say to God,“How awesome are Your works!Through the greatness of Your power Your enemies shall submit themselves to You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>All the earth shall worship YouAnd sing praises to You;They shall sing praises to Your name.” Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Come and see the works of God;He is awesome in His doing toward the sons of men.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>He turned the sea into dry land;They went through the river on foot.There we will rejoice in Him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>He rules by His power forever;His eyes observe the nations;Do not let the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Oh, bless our God, you peoples!And make the voice of His praise to be heard,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Who keeps our soul among the living,And does not allow our feet to be moved.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>For You, O God, have tested us;You have refined us as silver is refined.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>You brought us into the net;You laid affliction on our backs.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>You have caused men to ride over our heads;We went through fire and through water;But You brought us out to rich fulfillment.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>I will go into Your house with burnt offerings;I will pay You my vows,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Which my lips have uttered And my mouth has spoken when I was in trouble.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>I will offer You burnt sacrifices of fat animals,With the sweet aroma of rams;I will offer bulls with goats. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Come and hear, all you who fear God,And I will declare what He has done for my soul.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>I cried to Him with my mouth,And He was extolled with my tongue.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>If I regard iniquity in my heart,The Lord will not hear.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>But certainly God has heard me;He has attended to the voice of my prayer.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Blessed be God,Who has not turned away my prayer,Nor His mercy from me!</p>
