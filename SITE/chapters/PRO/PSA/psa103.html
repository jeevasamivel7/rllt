<h2>Psalms 103  </h2>

<h4>  Praise for the Lord's Mercies </h4>
<h5>  A Psalm of David. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Bless the Lord, O my soul;And all that is within me, bless His holy name!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Bless the Lord, O my soul,And forget not all His benefits:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Who forgives all your iniquities,Who heals all your diseases,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Who redeems your life from destruction,Who crowns you with lovingkindness and tender mercies,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Who satisfies your mouth with good things,So that your youth is renewed like the eagle�s.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>The Lord executes righteousness And justice for all who are oppressed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>He made known His ways to Moses,His acts to the children of Israel.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>The Lord is merciful and gracious,Slow to anger, and abounding in mercy.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>He will not always strive with us,Nor will He keep His anger forever.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>He has not dealt with us according to our sins,Nor punished us according to our iniquities.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>For as the heavens are high above the earth,So great is His mercy toward those who fear Him;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>As far as the east is from the west,So far has He removed our transgressions from us.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>As a father pities his children,So the Lord pities those who fear Him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>For He knows our frame;He remembers that we are dust.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>As for man, his days are like grass;As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>For the wind passes over it, and it is gone,And its place remembers it no more.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlastingOn those who fear Him,And His righteousness to children�s children,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>To such as keep His covenant,And to those who remember His commandments to do them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>The Lord has established His throne in heaven,And His kingdom rules over all.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Bless the Lord, you His angels,Who excel in strength, who do His word,Heeding the voice of His word.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Bless the Lord, all you His hosts,You ministers of His, who do His pleasure.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Bless the Lord, all His works,In all places of His dominion.Bless the Lord, O my soul!</p>
