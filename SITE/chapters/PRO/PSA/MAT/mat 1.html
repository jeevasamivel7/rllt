<h4>Christ Born of Mary</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-18.htm">18</a>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.</p>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-19.htm">19</a>Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not wanting to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-20.htm">20</a>But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.</p>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-21.htm">21</a>And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-22.htm">22</a>So all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying:
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-23.htm">23</a>"Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,"which is translated, "God with us."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-24.htm">24</a>Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took to him his wife,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-25.htm">25</a>and did not know her till she had brought forth her firstborn Son. And he called His name Jesus</p>
