<h2> Matthew 6 </h2>

<h4> Do Good to Please God</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-1.htm">1</a><a style="color: #770000;">Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-2.htm">2</a><a style="color: #770000;">Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-3.htm">3</a><a style="color: #770000;">But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-4.htm">4</a><a style="color: #770000;">That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.The Lord's Prayer</a></p>
<h4>The Model Prayer </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-5.htm">5</a><a style="color: #770000;">And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-6.htm">6</a><a style="color: #770000;">But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-7.htm">7</a><a style="color: #770000;">But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-8.htm">8</a><a style="color: #770000;">Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-9.htm">9</a><a style="color: #770000;">After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-10.htm">10</a><a style="color: #770000;">Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-11.htm">11</a><a style="color: #770000;">Give us this day our daily bread.</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-12.htm">12</a><a style="color: #770000;">And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-13.htm">13</a><a style="color: #770000;">And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-14.htm">14</a><a style="color: #770000;">For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</a></p>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-15.htm">15</a><a style="color: #770000;">But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.Proper Fasting</a></p>
<h4>Fasting to Be Seen Only by God </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-16.htm">16</a><a style="color: #770000;">Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-17.htm">17</a><a style="color: #770000;">But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-18.htm">18</a><a style="color: #770000;">That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.Treasures in Heaven</a></p>
<h4>Lay Up Treasures in Heaven </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-19.htm">19</a><a style="color: #770000;">Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-20.htm">20</a><a style="color: #770000;">But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-21.htm">21</a><a style="color: #770000;">For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.The Lamp of the Body</a></p>
<h4>The Lamp of the Body</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-22.htm">22</a><a style="color: #770000;">The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-23.htm">23</a><a style="color: #770000;">But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!</a></p>
<h4>You Cannot Serve God and Riches</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-24.htm">24</a><a style="color: #770000;">No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.Do Not Worry</a></p>
<h4>Do Not Worry</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-25htm">25</a><a style="color: #770000;">Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? >/a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-26.htm">26</a><a style="color: #770000;">Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-27.htm">27</a><a style="color: #770000;">Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature? </a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-28.htm">28</a><a style="color: #770000;">And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:<a?</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-29.htm">29</a> <a style="color: #770000;">And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-30htm">30</a><a style="color: #770000;">Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-31.htm">31</a><a style="color: #770000;"> Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-32.htm">32</a><a style="color: #770000;">(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-33.htm">33</a><a style="color: #770000;">But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-34.htm">34</a><a style="color: #770000;">Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</a></p>
