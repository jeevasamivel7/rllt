<h2> Matthew 20 </h2>

<h4>The Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-1.htm">1</a><a style="color: #770000;">"For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-2.htm">2</a><a style="color: #770000;">Now when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-3.htm">3</a><a style="color: #770000;">And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-4.htm">4</a><a style="color: #770000;">and said to them, "You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you." So they went.</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-5.htm">5</a><a style="color: #770000;">Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise.</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-6.htm">6</a><a style="color: #770000;">And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and said to them, "Why have you been standing here idle all day?"</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-7.htm">7</a><a style="color: #770000;">They said to him, "Because no one hired us." He said to them, "You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right you will receive."</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-8.htm">8</a><a style="color: #770000;">"So when evening had come, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, "Call the laborers and give them their wages, beginning with the last to the first."</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-9.htm">9</a><a style="color: #770000;">And when those came who were hired about the eleventh hour, they each received a denarius. </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-10.htm">10</a><a style="color: #770000;">But when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise received each a denarius. </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-11.htm">11</a><a style="color: #770000;">And when they had received it, they complained against the landowner, </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-12.htm">12</a><a style="color: #770000;">saying, "These last men have worked only one hour, and you made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day."</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-13.htm">13</a><a style="color: #770000;">But he answered one of them and said, "Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-14.htm">14</a><a style="color: #770000;">Take what is yours and go your way. I wish to give to this last man the same as to you. </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-15.htm">15</a><a style="color: #770000;">Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with my own things? Or is your eye evil because I am good?"</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-16.htm">16</a><a style="color: #770000;">So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few chosen."</a></p>
<h4> Jesus a Third Time Predicts His Death and Resurrection  </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-17.htm">17</a>Now Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples aside on the road and said to them,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-18.htm">18</a><a style="color: #770000;">"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death,</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-19.htm">19</a><a style="color: #770000;">and deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify. And the third day He will rise again."</a></p>
<h4>Greatness Is Serving   </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-20.htm">20</a>Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Him with her sons, kneeling down and asking something from Him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-21.htm">21</a>And He said to her,<a style="color: #770000;"> "What do you wish?"</a>She said to Him, "Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one on Your right hand and the other on the left, in Your kingdom."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-22.htm">22</a>But Jesus answered and said,<a style="color: #770000;"> "You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?"</a>They said to Him, "We are able."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-23.htm">23</a>So He said to them, <a style="color: #770000;">"You will indeed drink My cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with; but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it is prepared by My Father."</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-24.htm">24</a>And when the ten heard it, they were greatly displeased with the two brothers. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-25.htm">25</a><a style="color: #770000;">But Jesus called them to Himself and said,<a style="color: #770000;"> "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who are great exercise authority over them.</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-26.htm">26</a><a style="color: #770000;">Yet it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you, let him be your servant.</a> 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-27.htm">27</a><a style="color: #770000;">And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your slave" </a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm">28</a><a style="color: #770000;">just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many."</a></p>
<h4> Two Blind Men Receive Their Sight  </h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-29.htm">29</a>Now as they went out of Jericho, a great multitude followed Him. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-30.htm">30</a>And behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, "Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-31.htm">31</a>Then the multitude warned them that they should be quiet; but they cried out all the more, saying, "Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-32.htm">32</a>So Jesus stood still and called them, and said, <a style="color: #770000;">"What do you want Me to do for you?"</a>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-33.htm">33</a>They said to Him, "Lord, that our eyes may be opened."
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-34.htm">34</a>So Jesus had compassion and touched their eyes. And immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed Him.</p>
