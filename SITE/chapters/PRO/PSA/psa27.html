<h2> Psalms 27</h2>
     <h4>An Exuberant Declaration of Faith </h4>
<h4>  A Psalm of David. </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-1.htm">1</a>The Lord is my light and my salvation;Whom shall I fear?The Lord is the strength of my life;Of whom shall I be afraid?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-2.htm">2</a>When the wicked came against meTo eat up my flesh,My enemies and foes,They stumbled and fell.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-3.htm">3</a>Though an army may encamp against me,My heart shall not fear;Though war may rise against me,In this I will be confident.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-4.htm">4</a>One thing I have desired of the Lord,That will I seek:That I may dwell in the house of the LordAll the days of my life,To behold the beauty of the Lord,And to inquire in His temple.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-5.htm">5</a>For in the time of troubleHe shall hide me in His pavilion;In the secret place of His tabernacleHe shall hide me;He shall set me high upon a rock.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-6.htm">6</a>And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me;Therefore I will offer sacrifices of joy in His tabernacle;I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-7.htm">7</a>Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice!Have mercy also upon me, and answer me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-8.htm">8</a>When You said, "Seek My face,"My heart said to You, "Your face, Lord, I will seek."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-9.htm">9</a>Do not hide Your face from me;Do not turn Your servant away in anger;You have been my help;Do not leave me nor forsake me,O God of my salvation.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-10.htm">10</a>When my father and my mother forsake me,Then the Lord will take care of me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-11.htm">11</a>Teach me Your way, O Lord,And lead me in a smooth path, because of my enemies.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-12.htm">12</a>Do not deliver me to the will of my adversaries;For false witnesses have risen against me,And such as breathe out violence.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-13.htm">13</a>I would have lost heart, unless I had believedThat I would see the goodness of the LordIn the land of the living.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-14.htm">14</a>Wait on the Lord;Be of good courage,And He shall strengthen your heart;Wait, I say, on the Lord!</p>
