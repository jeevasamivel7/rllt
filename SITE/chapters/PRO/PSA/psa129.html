  <h2> Psalms 129 </h2>
<h4>  Song of Victory over Zion's Enemies </h4>
<h5> A Song of Ascents.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>"Many a time they have afflicted me from my youth,"Let Israel now say-</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>"Many a time they have afflicted me from my youth;Yet they have not prevailed against me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>The plowers plowed on my back;They made their furrows long."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>The Lord is righteous;He has cut in pieces the cords of the wicked.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Let all those who hate Zion Be put to shame and turned back.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Let them be as the grass on the housetops,Which withers before it grows up,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>With which the reaper does not fill his hand,Nor he who binds sheaves, his arms.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Neither let those who pass by them say,"The blessing of the Lord be upon you;We bless you in the name of the Lord!"</p>
