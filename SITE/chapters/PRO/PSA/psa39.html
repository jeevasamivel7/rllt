<h2>Psalms 39  </h2>

<h4> Prayer for Wisdom and Forgiveness  </h4>
<h5>  To the Chief Musician. To Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-1.htm">1</a>I said, "I will guard my ways,Lest I sin with my tongue;I will restrain my mouth with a muzzle,While the wicked are before me."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-2.htm">2</a>I was mute with silence,I held my peace even from good;And my sorrow was stirred up.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-3.htm">3</a>My heart was hot within me;While I was musing, the fire burned.Then I spoke with my tongue:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-4.htm">4</a>"Lord, make me to know my end,And what is the measure of my days,That I may know how frail I am.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-5.htm">5</a>Indeed, You have made my days as handbreadths,And my age is as nothing before You;Certainly every man at his best state is but vapor. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-6.htm">6</a>Surely every man walks about like a shadow;Surely they busy themselves in vain;He heaps up riches,And does not know who will gather them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-7.htm">7</a>"And now, Lord, what do I wait for?My hope is in You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-8.htm">8</a>Deliver me from all my transgressions;Do not make me the reproach of the foolish.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-9.htm">9</a>I was mute, I did not open my mouth,Because it was You who did it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-10.htm">10</a>Remove Your plague from me;I am consumed by the blow of Your hand.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-11.htm">11</a>When with rebukes You correct man for iniquity,You make his beauty melt away like a moth;Surely every man is vapor. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-12.htm">12</a>"Hear my prayer, O Lord,And give ear to my cry;Do not be silent at my tears;For I am a stranger with You,A sojourner, as all my fathers were.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-13.htm">13</a>Remove Your gaze from me, that I may regain strength,Before I go away and am no more."</p>
