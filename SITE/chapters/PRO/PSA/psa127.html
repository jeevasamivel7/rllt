<h2>Psalms 127  </h2>

<h4>Laboring and Prospering with the Lord   </h4>
<h5> A Song of Ascents. Of Solomon.  </h5>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/127-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Unless the Lord builds the house,They labor in vain who build it;Unless the Lord guards the city,The watchman stays awake in vain.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/127-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>It is vain for you to rise up early,To sit up late,To eat the bread of sorrows;For so He gives His beloved sleep.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/127-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Behold, children are a heritage from the Lord,The fruit of the womb is a reward.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/127-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Like arrows in the hand of a warrior,So are the children of one's youth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/127-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them;They shall not be ashamed,But shall speak with their enemies in the gate.</p>
