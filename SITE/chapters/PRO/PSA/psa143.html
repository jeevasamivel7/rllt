<h2>Psalms 143  </h2>

<h4> 
An Earnest Appeal for Guidance and Deliverance  </h4>
<h5> A Psalm of David.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Hear my prayer, O Lord,Give ear to my supplications!In Your faithfulness answer me,And in Your righteousness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Do not enter into judgment with Your servant,For in Your sight no one living is righteous.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>For the enemy has persecuted my soul;He has crushed my life to the ground;He has made me dwell in darkness,Like those who have long been dead.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me;My heart within me is distressed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>I remember the days of old;I meditate on all Your works;I muse on the work of Your hands.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>I spread out my hands to You;My soul longs for You like a thirsty land. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>7Answer me speedily, O Lord;My spirit fails!Do not hide Your face from me,Lest I be like those who go down into the pit.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Cause me to hear Your lovingkindness in the morning,For in You do I trust;Cause me to know the way in which I should walk,For I lift up my soul to You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Deliver me, O Lord, from my enemies;In You I take shelter.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Teach me to do Your will,For You are my God;Your Spirit is good.Lead me in the land of uprightness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Revive me, O Lord, for Your name's sake!For Your righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>In Your mercy cut off my enemies,And destroy all those who afflict my soul;For I am Your servant.</p>
