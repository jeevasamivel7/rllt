<h2>Psalms 55  </h2>

<h4> Trust in God Concerning the Treachery of Friends  </h4>
<h5>  To the Chief Musician. With stringed instruments. A Contemplation of David. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Give ear to my prayer, O God,And do not hide Yourself from my supplication.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Attend to me, and hear me;I am restless in my complaint, and moan noisily,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Because of the voice of the enemy,Because of the oppression of the wicked;For they bring down trouble upon me,And in wrath they hate me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>My heart is severely pained within me,And the terrors of death have fallen upon me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Fearfulness and trembling have come upon me,And horror has overwhelmed me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>So I said, “Oh, that I had wings like a dove!I would fly away and be at rest.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Indeed, I would wander far off,And remain in the wilderness. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>I would hasten my escapeFrom the windy storm and tempest.”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues,For I have seen violence and strife in the city.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Day and night they go around it on its walls;Iniquity and trouble are also in the midst of it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Destruction is in its midst;Oppression and deceit do not depart from its streets.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>For it is not an enemy who reproaches me;Then I could bear it.Nor is it one who hates me who has exalted himself against me;Then I could hide from him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>But it was you, a man my equal,My companion and my acquaintance.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>We took sweet counsel together,And walked to the house of God in the throng.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Let death seize them;Let them go down alive into hell,For wickedness is in their dwellings and among them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>As for me, I will call upon God,And the Lord shall save me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Evening and morning and at noonI will pray, and cry aloud,And He shall hear my voice.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me,For there were many against me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>God will hear, and afflict them,Even He who abides from of old. SelahBecause they do not change,Therefore they do not fear God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>He has put forth his hands against those who were at peace with him;He has broken his covenant.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>The words of his mouth were smoother than butter,But war was in his heart;His words were softer than oil,Yet they were drawn swords.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Cast your burden on the Lord,And He shall sustain you;He shall never permit the righteous to be moved.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>But You, O God, shall bring them down to the pit of destruction;Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days;But I will trust in You.</p>
