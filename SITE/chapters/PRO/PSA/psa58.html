<h2>Psalms 58  </h2>

<h4>  The Just Judgment of the Wicked </h4>
<h5> To the Chief Musician. Set to “Do Not Destroy.” A Michtam of David.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Do you indeed speak righteousness, you silent ones?Do you judge uprightly, you sons of men?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>No, in heart you work wickedness;You weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>The wicked are estranged from the womb;They go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Their poison is like the poison of a serpent;They are like the deaf cobra that stops its ear,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Which will not heed the voice of charmers,Charming ever so skillfully.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-6.htm" target="_blank">6/a>Break their teeth in their mouth, O God!Break out the fangs of the young lions, O Lord!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Let them flow away as waters which run continually;When he bends his bow,Let his arrows be as if cut in pieces.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Let them be like a snail which melts away as it goes,Like a stillborn child of a woman, that they may not see the sun.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Before your pots can feel the burning thorns,He shall take them away as with a whirlwind,As in His living and burning wrath.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance;He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>So that men will say,“Surely there is a reward for the righteous;Surely He is God who judges in the earth.”</p>
