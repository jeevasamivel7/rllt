<h2> John 10 </h2>


<h4>Jesus the True Shepherd</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a><a style="color:#770000;">“Most assuredly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a><a style="color:#770000;">But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</a> </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a><a style="color:#770000;">To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.</a> </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a><a style="color:#770000;">And when he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them; and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.</a>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a><a style="color:#770000;">Yet they will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.”</a>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Jesus used this illustration, but they did not understand the things which He spoke to them.</p>



<h4>Jesus the Good Shepherd</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Then Jesus said to them again,<a style="color:#770000;"> “Most assuredly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.</a> 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a><a style="color:#770000;">All who ever came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a><a style="color:#770000;">I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.</a></p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a><a style="color:#770000;">The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.</a></p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a><a style="color:#770000;">“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep.</a> 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a><a style="color:#770000;">But a hireling, he who is not the shepherd, one who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf catches the sheep and scatters them.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a><a style="color:#770000;">The hireling flees because he is a hireling and does not care about the sheep.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a><a style="color:#770000;">I am the good shepherd; and I know My sheep, and am known by My own.</a></p>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a><a style="color:#770000;">As the Father knows Me, even so I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.</a> </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a><a style="color:#770000;">And other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they will hear My voice; and there will be one flock and one shepherd.</a></p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a><a style="color:#770000;">“Therefore My Father loves Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it again.</a>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a><a style="color:#770000;">No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command I have received from My Father.”</a></p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Therefore there was a division again among the Jews because of these sayings.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>And many of them said, “He has a demon and is mad. Why do you listen to Him?”</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Others said, “These are not the words of one who has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”



<h4>The Shepherd Knows His Sheep</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Now it was the Feast of Dedication in Jerusalem, and it was winter. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>And Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon’s porch. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>Then the Jews surrounded Him and said to Him, “How long do You keep us in doubt? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.”</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Jesus answered them,<a style="color:#770000;"> “I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in My Father’s name, they bear witness of Me.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a><a style="color:#770000;">But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep, as I said to you.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a><a style="color:#770000;">My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.</a> 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a><a style="color:#770000;">And I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a><a style="color:#770000;">My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of My Father’s hand.</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a><a style="color:#770000;">I and My Father are one.”</p>

<h4>Renewed Efforts to Stone Jesus</h4>




<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>Then the Jews took up stones again to stone Him.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>Jesus answered them, “Many good works I have shown you from My Father. For which of those works do you stone Me?”</p>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>The Jews answered Him, saying, “For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a Man, make Yourself God.”</p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>Jesus answered them,<a style="color:#770000;"> “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said, “You are gods” ’</a>? 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a><a style="color:#770000;">If He called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken),</a></p>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-36.htm" target="_blank">36</a><a style="color:#770000;">do you say of Him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?</a> </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-37.htm" target="_blank">37</a>If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me; </p>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-38.htm" target="_blank">38</a><a style="color:#770000;">but if I do, though you do not believe Me, believe the works, that you may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in Him.”</a>
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-39.htm" target="_blank">39</a>Therefore they sought again to seize Him, but He escaped out of their hand.</p>

<h4>The Believers Beyond Jordan</h4>



<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-40.htm" target="_blank">40</a>And He went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was baptizing at first, and there He stayed. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-41.htm" target="_blank">41</a>Then many came to Him and said, “John performed no sign, but all the things that John spoke about this Man were true.”
<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-42.htm" target="_blank">42</a>And many believed in Him there.,</p>
