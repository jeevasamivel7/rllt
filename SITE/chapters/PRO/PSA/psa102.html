<h2>Psalms 102  </h2>

<h4>  The Lord’s Eternal Love </h4>
<h5>  A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed and pours out his complaint before the Lord. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Hear my prayer, O Lord,And let my cry come to You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Do not hide Your face from me in the day of my trouble;Incline Your ear to me;In the day that I call, answer me speedily.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>For my days are consumed like smoke,And my bones are burned like a hearth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>My heart is stricken and withered like grass,So that I forget to eat my bread.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Because of the sound of my groaning My bones cling to my skin.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>I am like a pelican of the wilderness;I am like an owl of the desert.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>I lie awake,And am like a sparrow alone on the housetop.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>My enemies reproach me all day long;Those who deride me swear an oath against me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>For I have eaten ashes like bread,And mingled my drink with weeping,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Because of Your indignation and Your wrath;For You have lifted me up and cast me away.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>My days are like a shadow that lengthens,And I wither away like grass.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>But You, O Lord, shall endure forever,And the remembrance of Your name to all generations.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>You will arise and have mercy on Zion;For the time to favor her,Yes, the set time, has come.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>For Your servants take pleasure in her stones,And show favor to her dust.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>So the nations shall fear the name of the Lord,And all the kings of the earth Your glory.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>For the Lord shall build up Zion;He shall appear in His glory.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>He shall regard the prayer of the destitute,And shall not despise their prayer.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>This will be written for the generation to come,That a people yet to be created may praise the Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>For He looked down from the height of His sanctuary;From heaven the Lord viewed the earth,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>To hear the groaning of the prisoner,To release those appointed to death,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>To declare the name of the Lord in Zion,And His praise in Jerusalem,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>When the peoples are gathered together,And the kingdoms, to serve the Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>He weakened my strength in the way;He shortened my days.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>I said, “O my God,Do not take me away in the midst of my days;Your years are throughout all generations.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Of old You laid the foundation of the earth,And the heavens are the work of Your hands.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>They will perish, but You will endure;Yes, they will all grow old like a garment;Like a cloak You will change them,And they will be changed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>But You are the same,And Your years will have no end.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>The children of Your servants will continue,And their descendants will be established before You.”</p>
