<h2> Psalms 10 </h2>

<h4>A Song of Confidence in God's Triumph over Evil</h4>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-1.htm">1</a>1Why do You stand afar off, O Lord?Why do You hide in times of trouble?</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-2.htm">2</a>The wicked in his pride persecutes the poor;Let them be caught in the plots which they have devised.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-3.htm">3</a>For the wicked boasts of his heart's desire;He blesses the greedy and renounces the Lord.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-4.htm">4</a>The wicked in his proud countenance does not seek God;God is in none of his thoughts.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-5.htm">5</a>His ways are always prospering;Your judgments are far above, out of his sight;As for all his enemies, he sneers at them.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-6.htm">6</a>He has said in his heart, "I shall not be moved;I shall never be in adversity."</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-7.htm">7</a>His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression;Under his tongue is trouble and iniquity.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-8.htm">8</a>He sits in the lurking places of the villages;In the secret places he murders the innocent;His eyes are secretly fixed on the helpless.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-9.htm">9</a>He lies in wait secretly, as a lion in his den;He lies in wait to catch the poor;He catches the poor when he draws him into his net.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-10.htm">10</a>So he crouches, he lies low,That the helpless may fall by his strength.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-11.htm">11</a>He has said in his heart,"God has forgotten;He hides His face;He will never see."</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-12.htm">12</a>Arise, O Lord!O God, lift up Your hand!Do not forget the humble.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-13.htm">13</a>Why do the wicked renounce God?He has said in his heart "You will not require an account."</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-14.htm">14</a>But You have seen, for You observe trouble and grief,To repay it by Your hand.The helpless commits himself to You;You are the helper of the fatherless.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-15.htm">15</a>Break the arm of the wicked and the evil man;Seek out his wickedness until You find none.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-16.htm">16</a>The Lord is King forever and ever;The nations have perished out of His land.</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-17.htm">17</a>Lord, You have heard the desire of the humble;You will prepare their heart;You will cause Your ear to hear,</p>
<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-18.htm">18</a>To do justice to the fatherless and the oppressed,That the man of the earth may oppress no more.</p>
