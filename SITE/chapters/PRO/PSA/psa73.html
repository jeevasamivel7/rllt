<h2>Psalms 73  </h2>

<h4> The Tragedy of the Wicked, and the Blessedness of Trust in God  </h4>
<h5>  A Psalm of Asaph. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Truly God is good to Israel,To such as are pure in heart.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled;My steps had nearly slipped.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>For I was envious of the boastful,When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>For there are no pangs in their death,But their strength is firm.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>They are not in trouble as other men,Nor are they plagued like other men.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Therefore pride serves as their necklace;Violence covers them like a garment.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Their eyes bulge with abundance;They have more than heart could wish.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>They scoff and speak wickedly concerning oppression;They speak loftily.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>They set their mouth against the heavens,And their tongue walks through the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Therefore his people return here,And waters of a full cup are drained by them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>And they say, “How does God know?And is there knowledge in the Most High?”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Behold, these are the ungodly,Who are always at ease;They increase in riches.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Surely I have cleansed my heart in vain,And washed my hands in innocence.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>For all day long I have been plagued,And chastened every morning.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>If I had said, “I will speak thus,”Behold, I would have been untrue to the generation of Your children.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>When I thought how to understand this,It was too painful for me—</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Until I went into the sanctuary of God;Then I understood their end.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Surely You set them in slippery places;You cast them down to destruction.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Oh, how they are brought to desolation, as in a moment!They are utterly consumed with terrors.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>As a dream when one awakes,So, Lord, when You awake,You shall despise their image.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Thus my heart was grieved,And I was [vexed in my mind.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>2I was so foolish and ignorant;I was like a beast before You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Nevertheless I am continually with You;You hold me by my right hand.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>You will guide me with Your counsel,And afterward receive me to glory.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Whom have I in heaven but You?And there is none upon earth that I desire besides You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>My flesh and my heart fail;But God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>For indeed, those who are far from You shall perish;You have destroyed all those who desert You for harlotry.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>But it is good for me to draw near to God;I have put my trust in the Lord God,That I may declare all Your works.</p>
