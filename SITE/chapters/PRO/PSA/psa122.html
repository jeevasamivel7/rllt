<h2> Psalms 122 </h2>

<h4>  The Joy of Going to the House of the Lord </h4>
<h5>  A Song of Ascents. Of David. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/122-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>I was glad when they said to me,"Let us go into the house of the Lord."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/122-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Our feet have been standing Within your gates, O Jerusalem!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/122-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Jerusalem is built As a city that is compact together,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/122-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Where the tribes go up,The tribes of the Lord,To the Testimony of Israel,To give thanks to the name of the Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/122-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>For thrones are set there for judgment,The thrones of the house of David.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/122-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:"May they prosper who love you.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Peace be within your walls,Prosperity within your palaces."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/122-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>For the sake of my brethren and companions,I will now say, "Peace be within you."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/122-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Because of the house of the Lord our God I will seek your good.</p>
