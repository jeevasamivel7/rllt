<h2> Psalms 20 </h2>

<h4>  The Assurance of God's Saving Work</h4>
<h5> To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-1.htm">1</a>May the Lord answer you in the day of trouble;May the name of the God of Jacob defend you;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-2.htm">2</a>May He send you help from the sanctuary,And strengthen you out of Zion;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-3.htm">3</a>May He remember all your offerings,And accept your burnt sacrifice. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-4.htm">4</a>May He grant you according to your heart's desire,And fulfill all your purpose.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-5.htm">5</a>We will rejoice in your salvation,And in the name of our God we will set up our banners!May the Lord fulfill all your petitions.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-6.htm">6</a>Now I know that the Lord saves His anointed;He will answer him from His holy heavenWith the saving strength of His right hand.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-7.htm">7</a>Some trust in chariots, and some in horses;But we will remember the name of the Lord our God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-8.htm">8</a>They have bowed down and fallen;But we have risen and stand upright.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-9.htm">9</a>Save, Lord!May the King answer us when we call.</p>
