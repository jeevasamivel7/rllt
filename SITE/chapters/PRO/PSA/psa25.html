<h5>  A Psalm of David. </h5>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-1.htm">1</a>To You, O Lord, I lift up my soul.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-2.htm">2</a>O my God, I trust in You;Let me not be ashamed;Let not my enemies triumph over me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-3.htm">3</a>Indeed, let no one who waits on You be ashamed;Let those be ashamed who deal treacherously without cause.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-4.htm">4</a>Show me Your ways, O Lord;Teach me Your paths.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-5.htm">5</a>Lead me in Your truth and teach me,For You are the God of my salvation;On You I wait all the day.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-6.htm">6</a>Remember, O Lord, Your tender mercies and Your lovingkindnesses,For they are from of old.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-7.htm">7</a>Do not remember the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions;According to Your mercy remember me,For Your goodness' sake, O Lord.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-8.htm">8</a>Good and upright is the Lord;Therefore He teaches sinners in the way.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-9.htm">9</a>The humble He guides in justice,And the humble He teaches His way.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-10.htm">10</a>All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth,To such as keep His covenant and His testimonies.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-11.htm">11</a>For Your name's sake, O Lord,Pardon my iniquity, for it is great.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-12.htm">12</a>Who is the man that fears the Lord?Him shall He teach in the way He chooses.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-13.htm">13</a>He himself shall dwell in prosperity,And his descendants shall inherit the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-14.htm">14</a>The secret of the Lord is with those who fear Him,And He will show them His covenant.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-15.htm">15</a>My eyes are ever toward the Lord,For He shall pluck my feet out of the net.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-16.htm">16</a>Turn Yourself to me, and have mercy on me,For I am desolate and afflicted.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-17.htm">17</a>The troubles of my heart have enlarged;Bring me out of my distresses!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-18.htm">18</a>Look on my affliction and my pain,And forgive all my sins.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-19.htm">19</a>Consider my enemies, for they are many;And they hate me with cruel hatred.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-20.htm">20</a>Keep my soul, and deliver me;Let me not be ashamed, for I put my trust in You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-21.htm">21</a>Let integrity and uprightness preserve me,For I wait for You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-22.htm">22</a>Redeem Israel, O God,Out of all their troubles!</p>
