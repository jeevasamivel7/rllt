<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>O Lord, God of my salvation,I have cried out day and night before You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Let my prayer come before You;Incline Your ear to my cry.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>For my soul is full of troubles,And my life draws near to the grave.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>I am counted with those who go down to the pit;I am like a man who has no strength,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Adrift among the dead,Like the slain who lie in the grave,Whom You remember no more,And who are cut off from Your hand.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>You have laid me in the lowest pit,In darkness, in the depths.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Your wrath lies heavy upon me,And You have afflicted me with all Your waves. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>You have put away my acquaintances far from me;You have made me an abomination to them;I am shut up, and I cannot get out;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>My eye wastes away because of affliction.Lord, I have called daily upon You;I have stretched out my hands to You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Will You work wonders for the dead?Shall the dead arise and praise You? Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Shall Your lovingkindness be declared in the grave?Or Your faithfulness in the place of destruction?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Shall Your wonders be known in the dark?And Your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>But to You I have cried out, O Lord,And in the morning my prayer comes before You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Lord, why do You cast off my soul?Why do You hide Your face from me?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>I have been afflicted and ready to die from my youth;I suffer Your terrors;I am distraught.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Your fierce wrath has gone over me;Your terrors have cut me off.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>They came around me all day long like water;They engulfed me altogether.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Loved one and friend You have put far from me,And my acquaintances into darkness.</p>
