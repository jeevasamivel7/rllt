<h2> Psalms 16  </h2>

<h4>The Hope of the Faithful, and the Messiah's Victory
A Michtam of David.</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-1.htm">1</a>Preserve me, O God, for in You I put my trust.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-2.htm">2</a>O my soul, you have said to the Lord,"You are my Lord,My goodness is nothing apart from You."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-3.htm">3</a>As for the saints who are on the earth,"They are the excellent ones, in whom is all my delight."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-4.htm">4</a>Their sorrows shall be multiplied who hasten after another god;Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer,Nor take up their names on my lips.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-5.htm">5</a> Lord, You are the portion of my inheritance and my cup;You maintain my lot.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-6.htm">6</a>The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places;Yes, I have a good inheritance.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-7.htm">7</a>I will bless the Lord who has given me counsel;My heart also instructs me in the night seasons.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-8.htm">8</a>I have set the Lord always before me;Because He is at my right hand I shall not be moved.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-9.htm">9</a>Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices;My flesh also will rest in hope.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-10.htm">10</a>For You will not leave my soul in Sheol,Nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-11.htm">11</a>You will show me the path of life;In Your presence is fullness of joy;At Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.</p>
