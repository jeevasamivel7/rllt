<h2> Psalms 114 </h2>

<h4> The Power of God in His Deliverance of Israel  </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/114-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>When Israel went out of Egypt,The house of Jacob from a people of strange language,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/114-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Judah became His sanctuary,And Israel His dominion.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/114-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>The sea saw it and fled;Jordan turned back.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/114-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>The mountains skipped like rams,The little hills like lambs.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/114-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>What ails you, O sea, that you fled?O Jordan, that you turned back?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/114-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>O mountains, that you skipped like rams?O little hills, like lambs?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/114-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord,At the presence of the God of Jacob,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/114-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Who turned the rock into a pool of water,The flint into a fountain of waters.</p>
