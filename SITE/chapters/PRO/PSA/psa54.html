<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Save me, O God, by Your name,And vindicate me by Your strength.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Hear my prayer, O God;Give ear to the words of my mouth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>For strangers have risen up against me,And oppressors have sought after my life;They have not set God before them. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Behold, God is my helper;The Lord is with those who uphold my life.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>He will repay my enemies for their evil.Cut them off in Your truth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>I will freely sacrifice to You;I will praise Your name, O Lord, for it is good.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/54-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>For He has delivered me out of all trouble;And my eye has seen its desire upon my enemies.</p>
