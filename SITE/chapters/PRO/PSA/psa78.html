<h2> Psalms 78 </h2>

<h4> God’s Kindness to Rebellious Israel  </h4>
<h5> A Contemplation of Asaph.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Give ear, O my people, to my law;Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>I will open my mouth in a parable;I will utter dark sayings of old,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Which we have heard and known,And our fathers have told us.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>We will not hide them from their children,Telling to the generation to come the praises of the Lord,And His strength and His wonderful works that He has done.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>For He established a testimony in Jacob,And appointed a law in Israel,Which He commanded our fathers,That they should make them known to their children;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>That the generation to come might know them,The children who would be born,That they may arise and declare them to their children,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>That they may set their hope in God,And not forget the works of God,But keep His commandments;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>And may not be like their fathers,A stubborn and rebellious generation,A generation that did not set its heart aright,And whose spirit was not faithful to God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,Turned back in the day of battle.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>They did not keep the covenant of God;They refused to walk in His law,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>And forgot His works And His wonders that He had shown them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Marvelous things He did in the sight of their fathers,In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>He divided the sea and caused them to pass through;And He made the waters stand up like a heap.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>In the daytime also He led them with the cloud,And all the night with a light of fire.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>He split the rocks in the wilderness,And gave them drink in abundance like the depths.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>He also brought streams out of the rock,And caused waters to run down like rivers.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>But they sinned even more against Him By rebelling against the Most High in the wilderness.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>And they tested God in their heart By asking for the food of their fancy.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Yes, they spoke against God:They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>Behold, He struck the rock,So that the waters gushed out,And the streams overflowed.Can He give bread also?Can He provide meat for His people?”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Therefore the Lord heard this and was furious;So a fire was kindled against Jacob,And anger also came up against Israel,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>Because they did not believe in God,And did not trust in His salvation.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Yet He had commanded the clouds above,And opened the doors of heaven,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>Had rained down manna on them to eat,And given them of the bread of heaven.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Men ate angels’ food;He sent them food to the full.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>He caused an east wind to blow in the heavens;And by His power He brought in the south wind.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>He also rained meat on them like the dust,Feathered fowl like the sand of the seas;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-28.htm" target="_blank">28</a>And He let them fall in the midst of their camp,All around their dwellings.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-29.htm" target="_blank">29</a>So they ate and were well filled,For He gave them their own desire.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-30.htm" target="_blank">30</a>They were not deprived of their craving;But while their food was still in their mouths,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-31.htm" target="_blank">31</a>The wrath of God came against them,And slew the stoutest of them,And struck down the choice men of Israel.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-32.htm" target="_blank">32</a>In spite of this they still sinned,And did not believe in His wondrous works.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-33.htm" target="_blank">33</a>Therefore their days He consumed in futility,And their years in fear.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-34.htm" target="_blank">34</a>When He slew them, then they sought Him;And they returned and sought earnestly for God.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-35.htm" target="_blank">35</a>Then they remembered that God was their rock,And the Most High God their Redeemer.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-36.htm" target="_blank">36</a>Nevertheless they flattered Him with their mouth,And they lied to Him with their tongue;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-37.htm" target="_blank">37</a>For their heart was not steadfast with Him,Nor were they faithful in His covenant.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-38.htm" target="_blank">38</a>But He, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity,And did not destroy them.Yes, many a time He turned His anger away,And did not stir up all His wrath;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-39.htm" target="_blank">39</a>For He remembered that they were but flesh,A breath that passes away and does not come again.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-40.htm" target="_blank">40</a>How often they provoked Him in the wilderness,And grieved Him in the desert!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-41.htm" target="_blank">41</a>Yes, again and again they tempted God,And limited the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-42.htm" target="_blank">42</a>They did not remember His power:The day when He redeemed them from the enemy,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-43.htm" target="_blank">43</a>When He worked His signs in Egypt,And His wonders in the field of Zoan;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-44.htm" target="_blank">44</a>Turned their rivers into blood,And their streams, that they could not drink.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-45.htm" target="_blank">45</a>He sent swarms of flies among them, which devoured them,And frogs, which destroyed them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-46.htm" target="_blank">46</a>He also gave their crops to the caterpillar,And their labor to the locust.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-47.htm" target="_blank">47</a>He destroyed their vines with hail,And their sycamore trees with frost.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-48.htm" target="_blank">48</a>He also gave up their cattle to the hail,And their flocks to fiery lightning.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-49.htm" target="_blank">49</a>He cast on them the fierceness of His anger,Wrath, indignation, and trouble,By sending angels of destruction among them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-50.htm" target="_blank">50</a>He made a path for His anger;He did not spare their soul from death,But gave their life over to the plague,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-51.htm" target="_blank">51</a>And destroyed all the firstborn in Egypt,The first of their strength in the tents of Ham.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-52.htm" target="_blank">52</a>But He made His own people go forth like sheep,And guided them in the wilderness like a flock;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-53.htm" target="_blank">53</a>And He led them on safely, so that they did not fear;But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-54.htm" target="_blank">54</a>And He brought them to His holy border,This mountain which His right hand had acquired.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-55.htm" target="_blank">55</a>He also drove out the nations before them,Allotted them an inheritance by survey,And made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-56.htm" target="_blank">56</a>Yet they tested and provoked the Most High God,And did not keep His testimonies,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-57.htm" target="_blank">57</a>But turned back and acted unfaithfully like their fathers;They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-58.htm" target="_blank">58</a>For they provoked Him to anger with their high places,And moved Him to jealousy with their carved images.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-59.htm" target="_blank">59</a>When God heard this, He was furious,And greatly abhorred Israel,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-60.htm" target="_blank">60</a>So that He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh,The tent He had placed among men,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-61.htm" target="_blank">61</a>And delivered His strength into captivity,And His glory into the enemy’s hand.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-62.htm" target="_blank">62</a>He also gave His people over to the sword,And was furious with His inheritance.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-63.htm" target="_blank">63</a>The fire consumed their young men,And their maidens were not given in marriage.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-64.htm" target="_blank">64</a>Their priests fell by the sword,And their widows made no lamentation.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-65.htm" target="_blank">65</a>Then the Lord awoke as from sleep,Like a mighty man who shouts because of wine.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-66.htm" target="_blank">66</a>And He beat back His enemies;He put them to a perpetual reproach.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-67.htm" target="_blank">67</a>Moreover He rejected the tent of Joseph,And did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-68.htm" target="_blank">68</a>But chose the tribe of Judah,Mount Zion which He loved.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-69.htm" target="_blank">69</a>And He built His sanctuary like the heights,Like the earth which He has established forever.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-70.htm" target="_blank">70</a>He also chose David His servant,And took him from the sheepfolds;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-71.htm" target="_blank">71</a>From following the ewes that had young He brought him,To shepherd Jacob His people,And Israel His inheritance.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-72.htm" target="_blank">72</a>So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart,And guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.</p>
