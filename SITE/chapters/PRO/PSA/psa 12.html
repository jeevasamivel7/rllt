<h2> Psalms 12 </h2>

<h4>Man's Treachery and God's Constancy
To the Chief Musician. On an eight-stringed harp. A Psalm of David.   </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-1.htm">1</a>Help,Lord, for the godly man ceases!For the faithful disappear from among the sons of men.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-2.htm">2</a>They speak idly everyone with his neighbor;With flattering lips and a double heart they speak.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-3.htm">3</a>May the Lord cut off all flattering lips,And the tongue that speaks proud things,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-4.htm">4</a>Who have said,"With our tongue we will prevail;Our lips are our own;Who is lord over us?"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-5.htm">5</a>"For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy,Now I will arise," says the Lord;"I will set him in the safety for which he yearns."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-6.htm">6</a>The words of the Lord are pure words,Like silver tried in a furnace of earth,Purified seven times.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-7.htm">7</a>You shall keep them, O Lord,You shall preserve them from this generation forever.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-8.htm">8</a>The wicked prowl on every side,When vileness is exalted among the sons of men.</p>
