<h4>The Character of Those Who May Dwell with the Lord
A Psalm of David.</h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-1.htm">1</a>Lord, who may abide in Your tabernacle?Who may dwell in Your holy hill?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-2.htm">2</a>He who walks uprightly,And works righteousness,And speaks the truth in his heart;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-3.htm">3</a>He who does not backbite with his tongue,Nor does evil to his neighbor,Nor does he take up a reproach against his friend;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-4.htm">4</a>In whose eyes a vile person is despised,But he honors those who fear the Lord;He who swears to his own hurt and does not change;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/15-5.htm">5</a>He who does not put out his money at usury,Nor does he take a bribe against the innocent.He who does these things shall never be moved.</p>
