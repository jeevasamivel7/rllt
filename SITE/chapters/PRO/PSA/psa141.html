<h2> Psalms 141 </h2>

<h4> Prayer for Safekeeping from Wickedness  </h4>
<h5>  A Psalm of David. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Lord, I cry out to You;Make haste to me!Give ear to my voice when I cry out to You.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Let my prayer be set before You as incense,The lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Set a guard, O Lord, over my mouth;Keep watch over the door of my lips.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Do not incline my heart to any evil thing,To practice wicked works With men who work iniquity;And do not let me eat of their delicacies.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Let the righteous strike me;It shall be a kindness.And let him rebuke me;It shall be as excellent oil;Let my head not refuse it.For still my prayer is against the deeds of the wicked.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Their judges are overthrown by the sides of the cliff,And they hear my words, for they are sweet.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Our bones are scattered at the mouth of the grave,As when one plows and breaks up the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>But my eyes are upon You, O God the Lord;In You I take refuge;Do not leave my soul destitute.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Keep me from the snares they have laid for me,And from the traps of the workers of iniquity.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Let the wicked fall into their own nets,While I escape safely.</p>
