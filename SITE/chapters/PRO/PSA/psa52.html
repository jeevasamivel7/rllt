<h2> Psalms 52 </h2>

<h4>The End of the Wicked and the Peace of the Godly   </h4>

<h5> To the Chief Musician. A Contemplation of David when Doeg the Edomite went and told Saul, and said to him, “David has gone to the house of Ahimelech.”  </h5>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Why do you boast in evil, O mighty man?The goodness of God endures continually.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Your tongue devises destruction,Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>You love evil more than good,Lying rather than speaking righteousness. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>You love all devouring words,You deceitful tongue.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>God shall likewise destroy you forever;He shall take you away, and pluck you out of your dwelling place,And uproot you from the land of the living. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>The righteous also shall see and fear,And shall laugh at him, saying,</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>“Here is the man who did not make God his strength,But trusted in the abundance of his riches,And strengthened himself in his wickedness.”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God;I trust in the mercy of God forever and ever.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>I will praise You forever,Because You have done it;And in the presence of Your saintsI will wait on Your name, for it is good.</p>
