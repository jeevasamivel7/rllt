<h2> Psalms 46 </h2>

<h4> God the Refuge of His People and Conqueror of the Nations  </h4>
<h5>  To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. A Song for Alamoth. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-1.htm">1</a>God is our refuge and strength,A very present help in trouble.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-2.htm">2</a>Therefore we will not fear,Even though the earth be removed,And though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-3.htm">3</a>Though its waters roar and be troubled,Though the mountains shake with its swelling. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-4.htm">4</a>There is a river whose streams shall make glad the city of God,The holy place of the tabernacle of the Most High.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-5.htm">5</a>God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved;God shall help her, just at the break of dawn.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-6.htm">6</a>The nations raged, the kingdoms were moved;He uttered His voice, the earth melted.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-7.htm">7</a>The Lord of hosts is with us;The God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-8.htm">8</a>Come, behold the works of the Lord,Who has made desolations in the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-9.htm">9</a>He makes wars cease to the end of the earth;He breaks the bow and cuts the spear in two;He burns the chariot in the fire.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-10.htm">10</a>Be still, and know that I am God;I will be exalted among the nations,I will be exalted in the earth!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-11.htm">11</a>The Lord of hosts is with us;The God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah</p>
