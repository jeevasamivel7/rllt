<h2> Psalms 41 </h2>

<h4> The Blessing and Suffering of the Godly  </h4>
<h5> To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.  </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-1.htm">1</a>Blessed is he who considers the poor;The Lord will deliver him in time of trouble.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-2.htm">2</a>The Lord will preserve him and keep him alive,And he will be blessed on the earth;You will not deliver him to the will of his enemies.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-3.htm">3</a>The Lord will strengthen him on his bed of illness;You will sustain him on his sickbed.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-4.htm">4</a>I said, "Lord, be merciful to me;Heal my soul, for I have sinned against You."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-5.htm">5</a>My enemies speak evil of me:"When will he die, and his name perish?"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-6.htm">6</a>And if he comes to see me, he speaks lies;His heart gathers iniquity to itself;When he goes out, he tells it.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-7.htm">7</a>All who hate me whisper together against me;Against me they devise my hurt.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-8.htm">8</a>"An evil disease," they say, "clings to him.And now that he lies down, he will rise up no more."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-9.htm">9</a>Even my own familiar friend in whom I trusted,Who ate my bread,Has lifted up his heel against me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-10.htm">10</a>But You, O Lord, be merciful to me, and raise me up,That I may repay them.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-11.htm">11</a>By this I know that You are well pleased with me,Because my enemy does not triumph over me.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-12.htm">12</a>As for me, You uphold me in my integrity,And set me before Your face forever.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-13.htm">13</a>Blessed be the Lord God of IsraelFrom everlasting to everlasting!Amen and Amen.</p>
