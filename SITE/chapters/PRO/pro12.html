    <h2> Proverbs 12 </h2>
    
    <h4>The House of the Righteous Shall Stand</h4>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-1.htm" target="-blank">1</a>Whoever loves instruction loves knowledge,
        But he who hates correction is stupid.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-2.htm" target="-blank">2</a>A good man obtains favor from the Lord,
        But a man of wicked intentions He will condemn.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-3.htm" target="-blank">3</a>A man is not established by wickedness,
        But the root of the righteous cannot be moved.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-4.htm" target="-blank">4</a>An excellent wife is the crown of her husband,
        But she who causes shame is like rottenness in his bones.</p> 
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-5.htm" target="-blank">5</a>The thoughts of the righteous are right,
        But the counsels of the wicked are deceitful.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-6.htm" target="-blank">6</a>The words of the wicked are, “Lie in wait for blood,”
        But the mouth of the upright will deliver them.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-7.htm" target="-blank">7</a>The wicked are overthrown and are no more,
        But the house of the righteous will stand.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-8.htm" target="-blank">8</a>A man will be commended according to his wisdom,
        But he who is of a perverse heart will be despised.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-9.htm" target="-blank">9</a>Better is the one who is slighted but has a servant,
        Than he who honors himself but lacks bread.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-10.htm" target="-blank">10</a>A righteous man regards the life of his animal,
        But the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.
        </p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-11.htm" target="-blank">11</a>He who tills his land will be satisfied with bread,
        But he who follows frivolity is devoid of understanding.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-12.htm" target="-blank">12</a>The wicked covet the catch of evil men,
        But the root of the righteous yields fruit. </p>

    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-13.htm" target="-blank">13</a>The wicked is ensnared by the transgression of his lips,
        But the righteous will come through trouble.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-14.htm" target="-blank">14</a>A man will be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth,
        And the recompense of a man’s hands will be rendered to him.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-15.htm" target="-blank">15</a>The way of a fool is right in his own eyes,
        But he who heeds counsel is wise.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-16.htm" target="-blank">16</a>A fool’s wrath is known at once,
        But a prudent man covers shame..</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-17.htm" target="-blank">17</a>He who speaks truth declares righteousness,
        But a false witness, deceit.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-18.htm" target="-blank">18</a>There is one who speaks like the piercings of a sword,
        But the tongue of the wise promotes health.</p>
     <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-19.htm" target="-blank">19</a>The truthful lip shall be established forever,
        But a lying tongue is but for a moment.</p>
     <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-20.htm" target="-blank">20</a>Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil,
But counselors of peace have joy.</p>
     <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-21.htm" target="-blank">21</a>No grave trouble will overtake the righteous,
        But the wicked shall be filled with evil.</p>
   <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-22.htm" target="-blank">22</a>Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord,
    But those who deal truthfully are His delight.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-23.htm" target="-blank">23</a>A prudent man conceals knowledge,
        But the heart of fools proclaims foolishness.</p>
     <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-24.htm" target="-blank">24</a>The hand of the diligent will rule,
        But the lazy man will be put to forced labor.</p>
     <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-25.htm" target="-blank">25</a>Anxiety in the heart of man causes depression,
        But a good word makes it glad.</p>
     <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-26.htm" target="-blank">26</a>The righteous should choose his friends carefully,
        For the way of the wicked leads them astray.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-27.htm" target="-blank">27</a>The lazy man does not roast what he took in hunting,
        But diligence is man’s precious possession.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-28.htm" target="-blank">28</a>In the way of righteousness is life,
        And in its pathway there is no death. </p>
