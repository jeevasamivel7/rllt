<h2>Psalms 61 </h2>

<h4> Assurance of God’s Eternal Protection  </h4>
<h5>  To the Chief Musician. On a stringed instrument. A Psalm of David. </h5>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Hear my cry, O God;Attend to my prayer.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>From the end of the earth I will cry to You,When my heart is overwhelmed;Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>For You have been a shelter for me,A strong tower from the enemy.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>I will abide in Your tabernacle forever;I will trust in the shelter of Your wings. Selah</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>For You, O God, have heard my vows;You have given me the heritage of those who fear Your name.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>You will prolong the king’s life,His years as many generations.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>He shall abide before God forever.Oh, prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him!</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>So I will sing praise to Your name forever,That I may daily perform my vows.</p>
