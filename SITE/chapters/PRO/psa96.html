<h2> Psalms 96 </h2>

<h4> A Song of Praise to God Coming in Judgment  </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Oh, sing to the Lord a new song!Sing to the Lord, all the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Sing to the Lord, bless His name;Proclaim the good news of His salvation from day to day.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Declare His glory among the nations,His wonders among all peoples.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>For the Lord is great and greatly to be praised;He is to be feared above all gods.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>For all the gods of the peoples are idols,But the Lord made the heavens.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Honor and majesty are before Him;Strength and beauty are in His sanctuary.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Give to the Lord, O families of the peoples,Give to the Lord glory and strength.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Give to the Lord the glory due His name;Bring an offering, and come into His courts.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Oh, worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness!Tremble before Him, all the earth.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Say among the nations, “The Lord reigns;The world also is firmly established,It shall not be moved;He shall judge the peoples righteously.”</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad;Let the sea roar, and all its fullness;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it.Then all the trees of the woods will rejoice</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>   before the Lord.For He is coming, for He is coming to judge the earth.He shall judge the world with righteousness,And the peoples with His truth.</p>
