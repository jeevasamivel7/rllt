    <h2> Proverbs 9 </h2>
    
    <h4>The Way of Wisdom</h4>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-1.htm" target="-blank">1</a>Wisdom has built her house,
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-2.htm" target="-blank">2</a>She has slaughtered her meat,
        She has mixed her wine,She has also furnished her table.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-3.htm" target="-blank">3</a>She has sent out her maidens,
        She cries out from the highest places of the city,</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-4.htm" target="-blank">4</a>“Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”
        As for him who lacks understanding, she says to him,</p> 
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-5.htm" target="-blank">5</a>“Come, eat of my bread
        And drink of the wine I have mixed.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-6.htm" target="-blank">6</a>Forsake foolishness and live,
        And go in the way of understanding.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-7.htm" target="-blank">7</a>“He who corrects a scoffer gets shame for himself,
        And he who rebukes a wicked man only harms himself.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-8.htm" target="-blank">8</a>Do not correct a scoffer, lest he hate you;
        Rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-9.htm" target="-blank">9</a>Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser;
        Teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-10.htm" target="-blank">10</a>“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,
        And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-11.htm" target="-blank">11</a>For by me your days will be multiplied,
        And years of life will be added to you.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-12.htm" target="-blank">12</a>If you are wise, you are wise for yourself,
        And if you scoff, you will bear it alone.”</p>
        <h3>The Way of Folly</h3>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-13.htm" target="-blank">13</a>A foolish woman is clamorous;
        She is simple, and knows nothing.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-14.htm" target="-blank">14</a>For she sits at the door of her house,
        On a seat by the highest places of the city,</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-15.htm" target="-blank">15</a>To call to those who pass by,
        Who go straight on their way:</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-16.htm" target="-blank">16</a>“Whoever is simple, let him turn in here”;
        And as for him who lacks understanding, she says to him,</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-17.htm" target="-blank">17</a>“Stolen water is sweet,
        And bread eaten in secret is pleasant.”</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-18.htm" target="-blank">18</a>But he does not know that the dead are there,
        That her guests are in the depths of hell.</p>
