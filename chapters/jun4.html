            <h4>Security in Wisdom</h4>
            
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Hear, my children, the instruction of a father,
            And give attention to know understanding;</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>For I give you good doctrine:
            Do not forsake my law.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>When I was my father's son,
            Tender and the only one in the sight of my mother,</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>He also taught me, and said to me:
            Let your heart retain my words;
            Keep my commands, and live.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Get wisdom! Get understanding!
            Do not forget, nor turn away from the words of my mouth.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>Do not forsake her, and she will preserve you;
            Love her, and she will keep you.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Wisdom is the principal thing;
            Therefore get wisdom.
            And in all your getting, get understanding.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Exalt her, and she will promote you;
            She will bring you honor, when you embrace her.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>She will place on your head an ornament of grace;
            A crown of glory she will deliver to you.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Hear, my son, and receive my sayings,
            And the years of your life will be many.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>I have taught you in the way of wisdom;
            I have led you in right paths.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>When you walk, your steps will not be hindered,
            And when you run, you will not stumble.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Take firm hold of instruction, do not let go;
            Keep her, for she is your life.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Do not enter the path of the wicked,
            And do not walk in the way of evil.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Avoid it, do not travel on it;
            Turn away from it and pass on.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>For they do not sleep unless they have done evil;
            And their sleep is taken away unless they make someone fall.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>For they eat the bread of wickedness,
            And drink the wine of violence.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>But the path of the just is like the shining sun,
            That shines ever brighter unto the perfect day.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>The way of the wicked is like darkness;
            They do not know what makes them stumble.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>My son, give attention to my words;
            Incline your ear to my sayings.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Do not let them depart from your eyes;
            Keep them in the midst of your heart;</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>For they are life to those who find them,
            And health to all their flesh.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Keep your heart with all diligence,
            For out of it spring the issues of life.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>Put away from you a deceitful mouth,
            And put perverse lips far from you.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>Let your eyes look straight ahead,
            And your eyelids look right before you</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-26.htm" target="_blank">26</a>Ponder the path of your feet,
            And let all your ways be established.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-27.htm" target="_blank">27</a>Do not turn to the right or the left;
            Remove your foot from evil.</p>

<h2>
    BOOK ONE
    Psalms 1
    </h2>
    <h4>
    The Way of the Righteous and the End of the Ungodly
    </h4>
    
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>
    Blessed is the man
    Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly,
    Nor stands in the path of sinners,
    Nor sits in the seat of the scornful;</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>But his delight is in the law of the Lord,
        And in His law he meditates day and night.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>He shall be like a tree
        Planted by the rivers of water,
        That brings forth its fruit in its season,
        Whose leaf also shall not wither;
        And whatever he does shall prosper.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>The ungodly are not so,
        But are like the chaff which the wind drives away.</p>
    
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment,
        Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
        </p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>For the Lord knows the way of the righteous,
        But the way of the ungodly shall perish.</p>

        <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>
            Why do the nations rage,
            And the people plot a vain thing?
           </p>
        
        <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a> The kings of the earth set themselves,
            And the rulers take counsel together,

          <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>“Let us break Their bonds in pieces

            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a> Ask of Me, and I will give You
            The nations for Your inheritance,

            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a> You shall break them with a rod of iron;
            You shall dash them to pieces like a potter’s vessel.’ ”</p>
            
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a> Now therefore, be wise, O kings;
            Be instructed, you judges of the earth.</p>
            <p>  <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a> Serve the Lord with fear,
            And rejoice with trembling.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a> Kiss the Son, lest He be angry,
            And you perish in the way,
            When His wrath is kindled but a little.
            Blessed are all those who put their trust in Him. </p>

        <h2>MATTHEW 1  </h2>

        <h4> The Genealogy of Jesus Christ  </h4>
        
        <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham:</p>

        <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>Abraham begot Isaac, Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers. 

         <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>Judah begot Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez begot Hezron, and Hezron begot Ram.

         <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Ram begot Amminadab, Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon

         <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Salmon begot Boaz by Rahab, Boaz begot Obed by Ruth, Obed begot Jesse,
         <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>and Jesse begot David the king.David the king begot Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah.</p>
        <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Solomon begot Rehoboam, Rehoboam begot Abijah, and Abijah begot Asa.
         <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Asa begot Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat begot Joram, and Joram begot Uzziah.
         <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>Uzziah begot Jotham, Jotham begot Ahaz, and Ahaz begot Hezekiah.
         <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>Hezekiah begot Manasseh, Manasseh begot Amon, and Amon begot Josiah.
         <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>Josiah begot Jeconiah and his brothers about the time they were carried away to Babylon.</p>
        <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>And after they were brought to Babylon, Jeconiah begot Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begot Zerubbabel
         <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Zerubbabel begot Abiud, Abiud begot Eliakim, and Eliakim begot Azor.
         <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>Azor begot Zadok, Zadok begot Achim, and Achim begot Eliud.
         <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>Eliud begot Eleazar, Eleazar begot Matthan, and Matthan begot Jacob.
         <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ.</p>
        <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, from David until the captivity in Babylon are fourteen generations, and from the captivity in Babylon until the Christ are fourteen generations.</p>
        <h4>Christ Born of Mary</h4>
        <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.</p>
         <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not wanting to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly. 
         <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.</p>
         <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.</p>
        <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>So all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying:
         <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-23.htm" target="_blank">23</a>Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel, which is translated, God with us.</p>
        <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-24.htm" target="_blank">24</a>Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took to him his wife,
        <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-25.htm" target="_blank">25</a>and did not know her till she had brought forth her firstborn Son. And he called His name Jesus</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br>

        <h2>MATTHEW 2  </h2>

<h4>  Wise Men from the East </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>saying, "Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him." </p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>So they said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>"But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,Are not the least among the rulers of Judah For out of you shall come a Ruler Who will shepherd My people Israel.""</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, determined from them what time the star appeared.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the young Child, and when you have found Him, bring back word to me, that I may come and worship Him also."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>When they heard the king, they departed; and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was.
<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy. </p>
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>And when they had come into the house, they saw the young Child with Mary His mother, and fell down and worshiped Him. And when they had opened their treasures, they presented gifts to Him:gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-12.htm" target="_blank">12</a>Then, being divinely warned in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed for their own country another way.</p> 
<h4>The Flight into Egypt</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise, take the young Child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I bring you word; for Herod will seek the young Child to destroy Him."</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>When he arose, he took the young Child and His mother by night and departed for Egypt,
<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt I called My Son.</p>
<h4>Massacre of the Innocents</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>Then Herod, when he saw that he was deceived by the wise men, was exceedingly angry; and he sent forth and put to death all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-18.htm" target="_blank">18</a>"A voice was heard in Ramah,Lamentation, weeping, and great mourning,Rachel weeping for her children,Refusing to be comforted,Because they are no more."</p>
<h4>The Home in Nazareth</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-19.htm" target="_blank">19</a>Now when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-20.htm" target="_blank">20</a>saying, "Arise, take the young Child and His mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the young Child's life are dead."
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-21.htm" target="_blank">21</a>Then he arose, took the young Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea instead of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned by God in a dream, he turned aside into the region of Galilee. 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-22.htm" target="_blank">22</a>And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, "He shall be called a Nazarene."</p>

<br><br><br><br><br>
<h2>MATTHEW 3 </h2>

<h4> John the Baptist Prepares the Way </h4>

<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-1.htm" target="_blank">1</a>In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-2.htm" target="_blank">2</a>and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!" 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-3.htm" target="_blank">3</a>3For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying:"The voice of one crying in the wilderness:"Prepare the way of the Lord;Make His paths straight.""</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-4.htm" target="_blank">4</a>Now John himself was clothed in camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-5.htm" target="_blank">5</a>Then Jerusalem, all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan went out to him
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-6.htm" target="_blank">6</a>and were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-7.htm" target="_blank">7</a>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, "Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-8.htm" target="_blank">8</a>Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-9.htm" target="_blank">9</a>and do not think to say to yourselves, "We have Abraham as our father." For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-10.htm" target="_blank">10</a>And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm" target="_blank">11</a>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.

<h4>John Baptizes Jesus</h4>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-13.htm" target="_blank">13</a>Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-14.htm" target="_blank">14</a>And John tried to prevent Him, saying, "I need to be baptized by You, and are You coming to me?"</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-15.htm" target="_blank">15</a>But Jesus answered and said to him, <a style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.534);">"Permit it to be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness."</a> Then he allowed Him.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-16.htm" target="_blank">16</a>When He had been baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon Him. 
 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm" target="_blank">17</a>And suddenly a voice came from heaven, saying, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."</p>
