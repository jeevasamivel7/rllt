<h4>Trust in the Salvation of the Lord
To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.</h4>


<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-1.htm">1</a>How long, O Lord? Will You forget me forever?How long will You hide Your face from me?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-2.htm">2</a>How long shall I take counsel in my soul,Having sorrow in my heart daily?How long will my enemy be exalted over me?</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-3.htm">3</a>Consider and hear me, O Lord my God;Enlighten my eyes,Lest I sleep the sleep of death;</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-4.htm">4</a>Lest my enemy say,“I have prevailed against him”;Lest those who trouble me rejoice when I am moved.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-5.htm">5</a>But I have trusted in Your mercy;My heart shall rejoice in Your salvation.</p>
<p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-6.htm">6</a>I will sing to the Lord,Because He has dealt bountifully with me.</p>
