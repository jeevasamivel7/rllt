Psalms 2

<h4>
    The Messiah’s Triumph and Kingdom
</h4>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-1.htm">1</a>
    Why do the nations rage,
    And the people plot a vain thing?
   </p>

<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-2.htm">2</a> The kings of the earth set themselves,
    And the rulers take counsel together,
    Against the Lord and against His Anointed, saying,</p>
    
  <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-3.htm">3</a>“Let us break Their bonds in pieces
    And cast away Their cords from us.”</p>
    
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-4.htm">4</a> He who sits in the heavens shall laugh;
    The Lord shall hold them in derision.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-5.htm">5</a> Then He shall speak to them in His wrath,
    And distress them in His deep displeasure:</p>
    <p>  <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-6.htm">6</a> “Yet I have set My King
    On My holy hill of Zion.”</p>
    
    <p>  <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm">7</a> “I will declare the decree:
    The Lord has said to Me,
    ‘You are My Son,
    Today I have begotten You.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-8.htm">8</a> Ask of Me, and I will give You
    The nations for Your inheritance,
    And the ends of the earth for Your possession.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-9.htm">9</a> You shall break them with a rod of iron;
    You shall dash them to pieces like a potter’s vessel.’ ”</p>
    
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-10.htm">10</a> Now therefore, be wise, O kings;
    Be instructed, you judges of the earth.</p>
    <p>  <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-11.htm">11</a> Serve the Lord with fear,
    And rejoice with trembling.</p>
    <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-12.htm">12</a> Kiss the Son, lest He be angry,
    And you perish in the way,
    When His wrath is kindled but a little.
    Blessed are all those who put their trust in Him. </p>
