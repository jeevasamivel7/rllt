            <h4>The Peril of Adultery</h4>
            
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-1.htm">1</a>My son, pay attention to my wisdom;
            Lend your ear to my understanding,</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-2.htm">2</a>That you may preserve discretion,
            And your lips may keep knowledge.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-3.htm">3</a>For the lips of an immoral woman drip honey,
            And her mouth is smoother than oil;</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-4.htm">4</a>But in the end she is bitter as wormwood,
            Sharp as a two-edged sword.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-5.htm">5</a>Her feet go down to death,
            Her steps lay hold of hell.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-6.htm">6</a>Lest you ponder her path of life
            Her ways are unstable;
            You do not know them.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-7.htm">7</a>Therefore hear me now, my children,
            And do not depart from the words of my mouth.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-8.htm">8</a>Remove your way far from her,
            And do not go near the door of her house,</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-9.htm">9</a>Lest you give your honor to others,
            And your years to the cruel one;</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-10.htm">10</a>Lest aliens be filled with your wealth,
            And your labors go to the house of a foreigner;</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-11.htm">11</a>And you mourn at last,
            When your flesh and your body are consumed,</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-12.htm">12</a>And say:
            �How I have hated instruction,
            And my heart despised correction!</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-13.htm">13</a>I have not obeyed the voice of my teachers,
            Nor inclined my ear to those who instructed me!</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-14.htm">14</a>I was on the verge of total ruin,
            In the midst of the assembly and congregation.�</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-15.htm">15</a>Drink water from your own cistern,
            And running water from your own well.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-16.htm">16</a>Should your fountains be dispersed abroad,
            Streams of water in the streets?</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-17.htm">17</a>Let them be only your own,
            And not for strangers with you.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-18.htm">18</a>Let your fountain be blessed,
            And rejoice with the wife of your youth.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-19.htm">19</a>As a loving deer and a graceful doe,
            Let her breasts satisfy you at all times;
            And always be enraptured with her love.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-20.htm">20</a>For why should you, my son, be enraptured by an immoral woman,
            And be embraced in the arms of a seductress?</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-21.htm">21</a>For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord,
            And He ponders all his paths.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-22.htm">22</a>His own iniquities entrap the wicked man,
            And he is caught in the cords of his sin.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-23.htm">23</a>He shall die for lack of instruction,
            And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</p>

    <h4>A Prayer for Guidance
    To the Chief Musician. With flutes. A Psalm of David.</h4>
    
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-1.htm">1</a>Give ear to my words, O Lord,Consider my meditation.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-2.htm">2</a>Give heed to the voice of my cry,My King and my God,For to You I will pray.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-3.htm">3</a>My voice You shall hear in the morning, O Lord;In the morning I will direct it to You,And I will look up.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-4.htm">4</a>For You are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness,Nor shall evil dwell with You.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-5.htm">5</a>The boastful shall not stand in Your sight;You hate all workers of iniquity.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-6.htm">6</a>You shall destroy those who speak falsehood;The Lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-7.htm">7</a>But as for me, I will come into Your house in the multitude of Your mercy;In fear of You I will worship towardYour holy temple.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-8.htm">8</a>Lead me, O Lord, in Your righteousness because of my enemies;Make Your way straight before my face.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-9.htm">9</a>For there is no faithfulness in their mouth;Their inward part is destruction;Their throat is an open tomb;They flatter with their tongue.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-10.htm">10</a>Pronounce them guilty, O God!Let them fall by their own counsels;Cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions,For they have rebelled against You.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-11.htm">11</a>But let all those rejoice who put their trust in You;Let them ever shout for joy, because You defend them;Let those also who love Your nameBe joyful in You.</p>
    <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-12.htm">12</a>For You, O Lord, will bless the righteous;With favor You will surround him as with a shield.</p>

                <h4> Satan Tempts Jesus  </h4>
                
                <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-1.htm">1</a>Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
                 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-2.htm">2</a>And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry. 
                 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-3.htm">3</a>Now when the tempter came to Him, he said, "If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread."</p>
                <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-4.htm">4</a>But He answered and said,<a style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.534);"> "It is written, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.""</a> </p>
                <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-5.htm">5</a>Then the devil took Him up into the holy city, set Him on the pinnacle of the temple,
                 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-6.htm">6</a>and said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down. For it is written:"He shall give His angels charge over you,"and,"In their hands they shall bear you up,Lest you dash your foot against a stone.""</p>
                <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-7.htm">7</a>Jesus said to him,<a style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.534);"> "It is written again, "You shall not tempt the Lord your God.""</a></p>
                <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-8.htm">8</a>Again, the devil took Him up on an exceedingly high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
                 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-9.htm">9</a>And he said to Him, "All these things I will give You if You will fall down and worship me."</p>
                <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-10.htm">10</a>Then Jesus said to him,<a style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.534);"> "Away with you, Satan! For it is written, "You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve.""</a></p>
                <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-11.htm">11</a>Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him.</p>
                <h4>Jesus Begins His Galilean Ministry</h4>
                <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-12.htm">12</a>Now when Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, He departed to Galilee.
                 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-13.htm">13</a>And leaving Nazareth, He came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,
                 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-14.htm">14</a>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:</p>
                <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-15.htm">15</a>"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,By the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan,Galilee of the Gentiles:</p>
                <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-16.htm">16</a>The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light,And upon those who sat in the region and shadow of deathLight has dawned."</p>
                <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-17.htm">17</a>From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, <a style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.534);">"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."</a></p>
                <h4>Four Fishermen Called as Disciples</h4>
                <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-18.htm">18</a>And Jesus, walking by the Sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
                 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-19.htm">19</a>Then He said to them,<a style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.534);"> "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men."</a></p>
                 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-20.htm">20</a>They immediately left their nets and followed Him.</p>
                <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-21.htm">21</a>Going on from there, He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. He called them, 
                 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-22.htm">22</a>and immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him.</p>
                <h4>Jesus Heals a Great Multitude</h4>
                <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-23.htm">23</a>And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease among the people.
                 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-24.htm">24</a>Then His fame went throughout all Syria; and they brought to Him all sick people who were afflicted with various diseases and torments, and those who were demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics; and He healed them.
                 <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-22.htm">25</a>Great multitudes followed Him from Galilee, and from Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.</p>

                 <p> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-1.htm">1</a>And seeing the multitudes, He went up on a mountain, and when He was seated His disciples came to Him.
                  <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-2.htm">2</a>Then He opened His mouth and taught them, saying:</p>
